Ransom's family from the oldest brother to the youngest:

1. Esla

    He died of tuberculosis. Mary Tone was named for a great Aunt Mary spinster who came to live with the Tones.

    Esla was a carpenter and the father's favorite child. He married Grace Adams, who came from a rich, stingy family. They had eight children. She was given a cow for milk for the kids. She fed them skim milk and sold the cream.

    Esla fed Richard with his own spoon, so they had to put him in a sanatorium. His wife farmed all the kids out to other farms.

2. Ransom

    Ransom's father was not very supportive of him. He was told he was not good for anything but milking cows. He was told that he was so bowlegged that a pig could run through them.

3. Roy

    Roy had only one child, Betty, then divorced and married again. His second wife had a son (who was an adult and married with kids before he was told of his adoption). This son was Billy.

    Roy's first marriage was to a woman he got pregnant at age 15. She was "everyone's woman," but Roy married her at 16. She died.

    His second marriage was with a "diseased woman." He kicked her out after 10 days.

    His third marriage was with the other woman, the mother of Billy.

    He went to some family picnics. He brought candy and gum. All the kids liked him, but the adults often frowned on him. He left home when he was 10 years old. He lived with another farmer.

4. Milo

    Milo's son David worked on Mt. Rushmore. He was his mother's favorite child. He had a nervous breakdown and then wanted to stay on at the sanatorium. So he did, as a gardener. He was an expert building finisher. He worked on early trailer homes.

5. Arthur (Grandma not sure of the order)

    Tony (Ransom) was three years old when Arthur died of "summer complaint," probably food poisoning. Tony was told not to cry. He replied, "I have something in my eye."

6. Sadie

    Sadie was the black sheep of the family. She "got the religion" — Assembly of God. She passed religion on to the kids except for Marilyn. But nobody liked Marilyn.

    Sadie's children are: Helen, Dorothy, Marilyn, Lucy and Donna. Jimmy was the only son, he became a rich trucker.

7. Ruby

8. Mary

    Mary lived in Elk Point, then moved to Albuquerque. From there, she moved to Lansing, Michigan, where she died.

9. Jack (Myron Eslick)

    Jack was the "poor relative" during the Depression.

    Jack had three children, Lyle, John, then Myron Eslick who was called Jack. ???

# Note from Grandma Tone  
  Dated Christmas 1978

The Tone home (or Ericson's?) In Elk Point is located on Washington Street across the street and west of the Congregational Church. Eslicks lived on the other side of the Church kitty-corner from the Ericson's (in the old Crowder House).

Grandpa Tone was taught to chew tobacco by his uncles who were not much older than he. He hid it under the Nichols' porch.

People would cross the state border from Iowa to get married in Elk Point which was the first county seat they would come to. Grandma (Tone?) would often be asked to be a witness. Sometimes they got paid — maybe 50c.

Nell Nichols remembered the date Grandma Tone was born for her birth certificate. Great-grandfather Tone lived there, too (in Elk Point in that house.)

How Grandma Tone fell in love with Tony:

Grandma went fishing in Glacier Park and caught a 21-inch trout. It landed on a gravel bar, got off the hook, and was ready to flop back into the river when Grandpa Tone threw himself on it and "rescued" her fish. Grandma was 21 or 22 years old. She had known him since she was three. Grandma was 23, Tony was 32 when they married. They traveled to Great Falls, Montana, to get married. They got stuck in the mud before they could get to the motel.

They had a ranch on the southeast side of Lake Francis (five miles north of Belier) in central-south Montana. They stood and watched their crops destroyed by hail one year. The wind got pretty bad at times, too. It would roll big rocks up against the house — one broke a window once. The wind lifted a hayrack over a fence. It wasn't a big gust of wind, but the straight, steady kind. Temperatures got way down. One time the car got frozen when it was -40 degrees. It had to be towed to a garage where it took half a day to unfreeze it with a blowtorch — inside the building!

Once the car transmission went out while driving, and Grandpa had to walk for help through a snowstorm at dawn. He saw the tops of the fence posts and knew he was still on the road. He went towards a house and heard the alarm clock ringing. This took place west of the river at Fort Pierce. The house belonged to one of Scotty Phillips' kids (the wife). His daughter had married a white guy. Scotty Phillips is a well known historic person, I think an Indian. Aunt Peggy was one and a half years old and got to play with the Indian kids.

They were on their way to Rapid City for a school job to a town 30 miles out of Wall, South Dakota. The kids had run the previous teacher out of school. They lived in a little one room shack where the stove burnt the bread on top and left it raw in the middle. When Grandpa Tone went to pick up the car, Grandma was left alone for the night and was afraid. There were a lot of drunks around and she couldn't lock the door, so she pushed the kitchen table up against the door.

They also had a ranch near Lewistown.

From Montana, they went to Salt Lake City. Grandpa needed one chemistry course to get into medical school. He was going to try for it because they had just had a good years wheat crop in Montana. Then, after he took the course, there weren't any crops coming in from Montana as expected. Grandpa got a job at Cleveland, Utah, a little town out of Price. This was in the 1920s something, and they were the only Gentiles in town. They had to board with another family. She remembers how good the balsam poplars smelled in spring.

Then Grandpa got a better job in Price, a mining town. This finished his teaching career here. The miners would go to work carrying a sled and a lunch pail. They would coast home at the end of the day.

When in Belier, Montana, Grandpa worked for George Minty, his brother-in-law. George went off and didn't pay Grandpa or the rest of the crew, so Grandpa borrowed on his insurance policy and paid them off. It was several hundred dollars. This town had a lot of Belgians settled there. The Belgians wrote a book about their early recollections of school. There was a big article about Grandpa. He was well liked and respected. Aunt Peggy or Mary might have it.

One of the DuPonts (of the famous DuPont Chemical Company) came to Elk Point to get a divorce. Great-Grandpa Nichols was his attorney. The DuPont farmed there for six months or so. The land has always been known since as DuPont's Pasture.

Great-great-grandfather Ericson died during a cholera epidemic. He died from taking so much medicine to keep from getting cholera, they say. His father didn't want him to go to school. When he emptied the kitchen ashes, he would take a stick to practice his letters. He came (from Sweden?) to Newark, New Jersey, when he was 10 years old. He sewed tailor-made suits. When the opportunity came to get land, he went to the Dakota Territories. She (?) and 10 brothers went. Grandpa Ericson stayed and went to college and then went to South Dakota. He was the first teacher in the first log cabin school building at Vermillion, South Dakota. He died in 1910 at 53 years old of a heart attack. He went to see Dale Carnegie about getting a library for the University. Carnegie had already donated a library to the town. As an argument for the donation, he told Carnegie he used to play ball on a vacant lot by Carnegie's house. He stopped to see Grandma Tone's sister in Oberlin and had to run for a train. That contributed to his heart attack. He got the library.

Great-great-grandma Ericson was a midwife. She used to have to go out in bad storms. She was very religious. She and Grandma Tone didn't get along. They had to share a bedroom and Great-great-grandma snored. Grandma would get out of bed and punch her to be quiet, but it wouldn't do any good. The snoring would start again before she was in bed.

Grandma Tone's other grandmother, Grandmother Hayes, was nice. She broke her hip and was on crutches for a long time til she died. She fell once and her collie dog "protected" her. He wouldn't let anyone touch her to help her up. She lived a long life.

If anyone goes to Elk Point or nearby, we should look up Grandma Tone's cousin, Florence Anderson (husband is Henry) who lives on Avenue L in Hayworden, Iowa — about 25 miles from Elk Point. Her older sister is Ruth Kier.

Will and Charlie Ericson are farmers in Alcester, South Dakota. Will is 80 years old.
