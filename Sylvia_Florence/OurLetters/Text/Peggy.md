# Appendix 1 â€“ Reminesces of Peggy {#peggy}

 Aunt Phyllis says that A. Peggy was the most giving person she ever know. If someone needed a meal, she was there. My memories include her annual Halloween parties, I don't remember if she had games, but she always wanted everyone to be in costume. My parents never did, so us kids didn't want to. I remember her answering the door and saying, "You were supposed to wear a costume!" We would carve our pumpkins and she would feed us cookies w/ M&amp;M's on top. She was my second favorite aunt (I had a hard time choosing my favorite. Aunt Mary Sorgaard was my favorite).

 She painted aerial photos of businesses, like sawmills in OR. $2.00 a piece and they'd take a LONG TIME to finish. Her husband never wanted to move away from Junction City, even though she did. He was a big fish in a little pond, as grandma Tone says. He knew everyone, worked for the PO for a while, on the fire department, wrote for the newspaper I believe, on the city council. He and Peggy were two of the founding 'fathers' of the Scandinavian Festival held in JC each year. The first year they didn't buy enough bread. They didn't realize so many people would come and ran out. Someone had to drive into Eugene to buy more.

 She was the dragon in the Scandinavian festival play in JC each year. She made the costume (even had smoke that came out of the mouth) and also painted the big back drop on the stage (she may have had help) I don't know if this is the same backdrop, but it looked like this one. I believe they've only had two in the history of the festival. Peggy's started getting pretty old. Hers was really detailed. As I remember, the 2nd one was a little more plain. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGr6NODQnwk&amp;feature=related

 Her first child was born with a heart problem and needed to be propped up on pillows at night. She watched over him constantly for I don't know how long. Then Uncle Vard said she had to sleep with him and the baby ended up sliding off the pillows and died.

 You should ask about her when all the sister's are together. We can come up with a lot of info.

 There's much more, but I need to get a genealogy class for the MIA maids finished (teaching tomorrow night). Will write more later.

 George M. is George Minty. He married Nell, Grandma Flo's sister. Flo's husband, Ransom Tone, let Geo. take care of his company when he was sick and Geo (who didn't know how to handle money) lost so much that the brokerage co, got into deep trouble. Ransom was taken before the board... long story. I'm in contact with one of Nell Minty's granddaughter's, Jean Shipley. She doesn't know our side of the problems between our grandfather's and I thought I'd let it stay hidden.

 I don't know how to do a Gedcom yet.

 Mary Elizabeth Tone was a crafty woman. She learned how to do silver work and made necklaces, she helped grandma Flo with her porcelain enamel beads, she learned how to make moccasins. She was educated as a librarian. Moved with her husband and family to NZ in the '60's. You may have met her when you were over there, but she had Alzheimer's and died last Nov (?). I didn't know Mary very well. She did send a lot of the Tone memorabilia back to the USA because she felt the Tone's were American's and this is where the stuff should be. You can certainly email our cousins in NZ (Jack, Nina, Edwin, and Alison). Mary was their mother. Do you still have their emails addresses?

 If you have the writings of Ransom Tone that I copied and gave to everyone (I think). You'll find that he talks about the tough times with Geo E. Minty. 1930's.

 Mary Tone Arron - we should fined out what her undergraduate degree is in, and what type of work, if any, she did outside of the house. She returned to Oregon in about 1969 or so (along with Alison and Edwin) to take classes at the university to earn a masters in Librarianship, I think. It was with this degree that she returned to NZ and worked in a library.

 Ed and I picked cherries that summer (68, 69 or 70?) and I remember him pulling a cucumber out of his brown paper lunch bag along with a shaker of salt. He'd peel down the cucumber, shake some salt on it, and slice off a piece to eat. Must have gotten the cukes from A.Peggy's garden.

 A. Mary got govt. surplus food of milk, flour, sugar, butter. She would make pans and pans of fresh cinnamon rolls, then give almost all of them away to the Nelsons and Tones. Maybe we were living in JC that summer, but then why wasn't Gini picking cherries, too? Anyway, Alison said years and years later that she felt like all the rest of the family looked down on her mother because she was "on the dole" at the time. They lived in a little white house you could see off River Road (maybe Prairie Road?) on a side street. They didn't come over with much, and I think most of their belongings going home were boxes of books.

 A. Mary and U.Walt lived in Alaska for a while. A.Mary made little masks about 2 inches high with clay that she found, and then painted them. I had one and gave it to Nina when she was here. Didn't think to take a photo. Mom has one still - maybe hanging with her big calendar in her bathroom?

 I think A.Mary has been crafty all her life. She also collected little figurines and carvings of mountain goats (not mountain sheep). A. Peggy collected wood handcarvings of people. She had quite a collection. I have a tall piece, a man, that I bought at a crafts festival that I was going to send her, but she died soon after I bought it. Some of her carvings were trolls. Later, on the same shelf in her house, she kept a collection of handmade glass paperweights that were quite valuable. She was holding them for Mike - it was his collection. They looked like giant marbles, some of them.

 We got to use "real" knives - kitchen paring knives - on our pumpkins at A.Peggy's parties. The toughest thing about jack o'lanterns is trying to light the candle inside. The flame would come up and burn your fingers and hand. U.Vard thought I was a sissy when I couldn't light my candle and asked him to do it. We would put the jack o'lanterns outside all in a row and Dad would take a picture of them. Even Dick joined in.

 I also remember Easter egg hunts in their front yard. And the neighbors on the driveway side of their house had a little playhouse behind their big pile of sawdust. They said we could go in, but I remember it always had cobwebs and was dirty. U.Vard had a shortwave radio and would send and receive messages using Morse Code. He would work amongst all the "junk" and mechanical parts in the back shed area. I think all those sheds in total square feet were probably as big as the house. It was only about 800 square feet, I think. Two bedrooms, teeny bathroom with toilet jammed up to the sink and a small shower stall. Very tiny kitchen, room for a round dining table jammed up against the wall. Fireplace. Seemed like it was always cold and I would sit on the hearth to stay warm. A.Peggy had a favorite black cat she called Annie that would sit on her chest while she watched TV. Either she or U.Vard liked to watch Perry Mason. Otherwise, they didn't sit around much. Always had a garden. Big apple tree in back, big maple tree right at the front door, and a huge green lawn. Later, the maple tree got chopped down. U.Vard had many varities of mint from the road up to the house along the side of the driveway. That's the first time I heard about chocolate mint.

 We still have some cassette tapes (letters) from U.Vard, and I have lots of letters I save from him, A.Peggy and Gr.Tone. The ones from A.Mary I may have shipped off to Alison a long time ago.

 That's all the memories for tonight.
