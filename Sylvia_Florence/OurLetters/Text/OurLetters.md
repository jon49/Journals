#### [1917-12-26 To Slim (iii)]

Dear Slim, It is two weeks since you left! Awful lonesome but we'll get more accustomed to it in time. 'Spose you are enjoying yourself at Dr. T.S. – music and all that – going to be a cold night. I wonder if you got cold going to town.

_Dec 26_ A.M. (still) Awful cold 0/22, chickens all frozen stiff and one pig dead. Breakfast is over and I'm going to put up the clothes line in refrigerator room and hang out the wash. There will be no danger of blackbirds.

P.M. Henry Whiteman was over. Brought the mail and was nearly frozen. Not above 0/22 today. I've frozen both hands and one foot so can't write much as it's my left foot I have to write with. I have written about a baker's dozen (not a modern baker) of letters, have put the clothes on the fine lines in the parlor and have fed the cat. Shall wash the dishes tomorrow, as its not pleasant washing a cup and spoon etc. each meal. How's me wife? Pretty lonesome here. Goodnight to Sleepy Slim.

_Dec 27_ I'm going to the mailbox and will send your letters. This is the coldest ye and a good wind from the N.E. Strange how it can snow when so cold. Hope you are having a good time with Judy. Plan to stay until you have visited all you want to. The goodness knows when you can get away soon. You'll have all you can do to feed the people and work in the gardens and irrigate the wheat next summer. Dishes not washed. Wished someone would come in that could and would fix up a feed. I can't. Because I'm married now and have forgotten how.

Love to my Slim and best regards to Judy. Ransom

Dec 26 – Wed AM –

_Dear Tony_, We have arrove [sic] safely in Conrad. Gee, isn't it cold? I hate to think of you hauling H~2~O and taking cows around visiting on such stormy days. Don't you dare catch cold! Geo & Nell stayed all night at Tidymans too. The kids had presents galore to exhibit – a lantern with which they could throw picture post cards etc on a sheet, Everett a new 22 etc. He's coming out to visit you perhaps, and get that rabbit behind the straw stack. Parboil him, and bake him on the oven with lots of butter, baste often and he'll be fit for a king to eat! The rabbit will, not Everett I mean.

We played Pit and Flinch until 11 – Mother and I didn't sleep much and I'm sleepy now. We have a room here at the hotel until our train this P.M. I've got a peach of a cold. Didn't catch it by washing my hands yesterday afternoon either, but by getting too warm and then too cold in Tidyman's furnace heated house. I'm a bad child – but I rejoiced when playing Flinch, to be able to keep Doc from playing a card off his Flinch pile four times in succession. Wasn't that sweet and kind of me? A bit of gossip. Dr. Milkard has turned 7th Day Adventist and he and his dad are on the outs. He goes soon to the army as a dentist. Mother's waiting to use the pen. We've just had a turkey sandwich and read a story in the Post. I wish you were here, going with me. Next winter we can, maybe. Be good, me Tough guy. I love you heaps Conrad – P.M. Tony, will you send me Dr. McKays letter – It's in the desk. And I forgot my pink pills. You might wrap them up, put on a 2¢ stamp and send 'em to 424 W. Quartz. Keep some out for yourself. I had to invest in a bottle of citrate of magnesia and some "Sally" to take along. I've been gulping down horrible bitter tablets every 15 minutes that Doctor gave me to break up my cold. Ugh! We stopped at the Drug Store and played a few records – Louise Homer, Alma gluck, Ms. Cormack and The Last Chord by Caruso. He surely can't sing English.

Great Falls – Park Hotel

Aha! Victory at last! The desired results have at last been attained after three pills last night at Tidyman's, a whole bottle of citrate of magnesia at Conrad and frantic searching's at the Drug Store at Great Falls for a little rubber fumy diddle like the one hanging hunder [sic] the window and hover the work stand. I feel better, a little. I have on the train. You would have laughed to see the grand dive I made for the toilet and arrived there just in time to get rid of my turkey sandwich my fig Newton, half a banana, three chocolates and contents of two quinine capsules. Gee kid, it was swell. You should a been there too. Ain't this the most interesting letter you ever read? Have your slippers come yet? If you don't like them, if they don't fit send them back to Mrs. Foutch and I can change them on the way home – happy time that will be. I'm lonesome. I've had two glasses of list lemonade and must go to sleep. Always your Slim.

#### [1917-12-27 To Slim (v)]

_Thursday Eve – Dec 27_

Dear Slim,

Your letter from Conrad came today. It made good time. sorry you have a cold already. It's bad weather for little girls to be traveling in over heated coaches. You'll be careful I hope. I just looked at the thermometer and it's 22 o'clock, and a good wind too, that moans and cries. I miss you a little. The poor dishes are still unwashed. Poor Chinese, Portugese [sic] and Silvereese (tears!) of them. Two more of them died today. Saddy hasn't been over. I got pretty cold going after the mail and to Mayden's.

Tell your mother I have heard from Philip and think we can get her a better renter for her land there.

Yes, I know about Dr. Milliard. I wrote a nice letter for Penn. Better give the rascal help than to try to keep him down. I hope he never finds out that I came so near to lieing [sic] for him. Good night, Tough. I love you quite a lot.

Ransom

_Friday Eve Dec 29_

Dear Tony,

Judy is seeing Mother off. I got sort of tired and came on home. We've been having the best time. This P.M. we went over to "the richest hill in the world." Where they mine 1/4 of the worlds copper. Visitors are not allowed down in the mine now because of the war, but we walked all around on the surface, saw the ore being dumped at the Big Diamond Mine – 3700' deep, the deepest mine in Butte. A nice old watchman gave me some fine specimens of copper ore and showed me around. I'd hate to have any one belonging to me working under the ground eight hours a day. There are old mines all over the place around here. A shaft goes down right her under Judy's house to an old silver mine. Its boarded up now, but think of living on top of an old mine. Butte is right in the mts. We crossed the Divide just a few miles before reaching here. It is warm and spring like as can be. 15&deg; above zero is the coldest weather they've had. It rained last night and it was -18&deg; when we left Great Falls yesterday A.M. the train kept stopping along the way so they could build a fire under the boiler to thaw it out and work up a little steam. Lost 3 hours just from G.F. It's a lovely ride tho', thru hills and canyons, following little creeks, valleys and rivers, so we didn't mind if they did run slowly!

Judy and I are going to see Anna Held a famous French actress in the musical comedy "Follow Me." The bill says "ravishing beautiful girls, facinating [sic] bewildering musical comedy direct from Casino, New York.

I gave your letter to Judy. She is a very discerning young woman. She read it and exclaimed "Crazy Nut" and then "did you write this?" Mother said you wrote her a very nice letter. Her feeling didn't seem to be injured any, at least she never shed a tear. She hasn't said a word to me about Xueno or Q.E.M or you. She'll get used to it someday. Jim Tidyman says people in the country can keep books as long as they want so you needn't be in any hurry with Eugenie. I don't imagine Balzac is very popular there in Valier anyway after Anna Held – quite good – we enjoyed being in a theatre. I feel selfish to be here having such a good time and you off at the shack, all by yourself. It seems quite a while since I left. I wish you were here Tony, me Fatface Baby, having a change and a rest too. Judy's nicer than ever. Write often to your Slim and don't you dare get sick.

Heaps of love,

Florence

Jan 1 – 1918

Tues Eve – I haven't wished you a happy new year yet, have I, except in my mind. Tony, we'll have lots of them, won't we, and I'm so glad this next year is going to bring some thing we've never had before. Won't it be great when he's old enough to talk and walk around a bit and to be taught things, and incidentally to teach us much too. I'll be glad when a letter comes from you. It isn't a week since I left and I think a couple of weeks more will see me home, even if I am having a glorious time. Judy's a good old scout, but I'd like to fly home to you for evenings and nights. You don't know how I miss your arm around me when I first get into bed and when I wake up in the morning. Ransom, I do love you so. You _couldn't_ care twice as much for me as I do, Tony. Good night. Please send me back a kiss when the wind is in the right direction and can bring it to me.

Your wife.

_Monday Eve._

Just a note before lunch. We're invited over to one of Judy's friends and she is going to take us to see Douglas Fairbanks. He is supposed to be good.

Judy had to see her doctor to get her certificate of vacination [sic] and I went in too with her and asked him a few questions, all for nothing. I mean free of charge. He says most folks like me do have pain in their right sides and there isn't much you can do about it, because it is due to pressure. I'm glad to know it is a normal proper pain to have and I'll proceed to forget it. He also said it wouldn't hurt me a bit to go swimming and to go down in a mine but not to do anything foolish like climbing Big Butte. I wanted to. There is a beautiful view from the top, but it is a mile high and kind of straight up so I'll be good this time. tony, let's not have another one _right_ away. Do you want me to get you some shoes? One store is having a big sale and perhaps I could find some if I knew what width and size. Saw some doady looking ones for 4.50.

Be good, Tough guy.

Florence

#### [1918-01-10? To Slim (viii)]

_Thursday Night_ and cold too – 88&deg;.

Dear Slim.

Awful cold here and I've got to go to bed to get warm. Glad you are going to stay longer. All D.K. here. No news or not much. Be good, skinny, and take good care of yourself. I miss you a little, wouldn't hardly want you never to come back and if I can prevent it without bloodshed you'll never get away from me again. I put your sandals and shoes and stockings and garters and cap into the other room because it always seems like you ought to be here where they are. Your 100^00^ dog is still with me, very much so in the mornings when I don't want to get up. It's nice you are so good with tatting so you can make so many nice things for our little girl. I've decided that we will call here Nell Margaret Julia Pauline Frances T.

Good night, Tough. Same amount, Ransom

#### [1918-01-10? To Tony (ix)] 

Thursday P.M.

Now maybe you think this tough guy wasn't glad to get your two letters from her old Fatface yesterday. Judy laughed and laughed over your cards, but I wish to tell you my name isn't _Florencie_ . You make a little mistake, is all.

>| I know a guy named "Fatface"  
>| On whom I have an awful case.  
>|    He calls me such names  
>| Most girls him would blame.  
>| But Fatface his wife can't faze.

Whoop! Ain't that swell? Can you beat it?

My, boy, but I wished for you last night when I was in the midst of that four course turkey dinner. More of Judy's friends asked us to dinner. They are old people, very courteous and charming and rather formal. We stayed and visited and then had a nice walk home. I walked at least three miles yesterday and think I'm pretty smart.

Judy has gone back to school again. About half have kids hadn't been vaccinated [sic] or didn't have their certificates so no regular work yet. Poor child, she has to skip off at 8:30 while I stay lazily in bed. Actually slept sound until nearly ten this morning. To change the subject, _honestly_ did any more chickens die? I never know if you are telling the truth and when you are trying to fool me. Miss Nash wants me to come down to Dillon [Montana] a week from Friday. Maybe Judy will go with me. She has her club this eve and I must get dressed & go down town after fruit for the salad and make the sandwiches. Tony, we didn't get our swim yesterday because of that invitation out to dinner. Wasn't that a shame? The pool is open only 2 afternoons a week – Wed & Thurs. I hope you are taking the trouble to cook enough so that you won't get sick. How is your cough? My cold is lots better. Take awfully good care of yourself, Roughneck, and don't get so used to batching it that you won't want me to come home –

Heaps of love to you,

Florence

#### [1918 To Slim (x)]

Dear Slim,

I think I hear Mayden approaching on wheels. We talked until nearly 3 o'clock this A.M. He's the most peculiarest sort I ever met. Is strongly religious. Would you ever think it. Hope you are still having good times. I won't get accustomed to batching it, you can bet on that. And I don't think just at the present of any one I'd rather see than my Slim. You are too my baby, aren't you Skinny. You know very well you are, Florencie. Shall I send your skates? I hope you don't go into the plunges. Please, Tough, stay out of that pool. That ass that said its all right probably is a Christian gentleman and I'll say he surely knows a lot more than I do about some such things, conditions, cases etc but he probably didn't know you weren't being up in Montana. You know you were a _woman_ _grown_ before you came out here.

Later. Just opened the door for Laddy. He has been here about a week in all, but left yesterday for awhile. I'm tired tonight. Glad Alford didn't come.

Be careful, dear, won't you and have all the good times you can. You needn't come home on our account. We are all O.K. here. ~~You needn't~~ Stay as long as you enjoy the visit – that is if it isn't more than a month more. You _must_ come by the last of the month because I always have the grippe about Feb 1. and you must be here to milk the cows, and keep the cat from coming in. I love you, Slim, and you know it best you don't know how much.

Ransom

#### [1918 To Tony (x-xi)]

_Tues Eve_

Dear Tony,

There isn't any stationary up here. Judy's in the bath tub and I'm in bed so pardon this. I went to school with Judy this afternoon. She has some cute kids but she has an awfull place in which to teach them. Noisy as the dickens. I 'spose you think if I was _very_ lonesome for you, I'd come home, but I'd sure like to see you now. I miss you so evenings and night. And likely as not you're glad I'm not there with cold feet to wiggle up and down your legs. Never mind, I'll more than make up for it when I get back. I'm tired and sleepy and achy so good night.

Always your Slim

#### [1918 To Tony (xi)]

_Wed. Eve_ – Thanks for the pink pills – They arrived all O.K. What are my many packages? I'm dying of curiosity. Open 'em up and let me know what they contain. We didn't sleep very well last night so I stayed in bed until 10:30 I should think you would want to, too, if Mr. Mayden visits you very often until the wee small hours.

Went to school in the afternoon and then on down to the swimming pool in the U.S. The water was so warm and we had the best swim, tho' I didn't swim very much. It has turned cold and snowy and the warm water feels pretty good. Done had my palm read today by one of the teachers. Would you like to know all about your wife? "You are a very nervous person and worry a great deal over unnecessary things. You are an ambitious young lady and carry to completion anything you make up your mind to do – you would be successful in public life you dislike detail. Science should have been easy for you. You should be very good in music. You are interested in the occult. You like artistic things around you. You are over sensitive. You will become wealthy & travel a great deal. You will have a serious illness and live to be 90. You have rather a nice disposition" etc etc. Now there isn't much in the whole thing that she couldn't have told any girl and the girl would be perfectly pleased and wonder if she really was like that. Must stop this rambling. I love you a lot.

Florence

#### [1918 To Tony (xi)]

_Thurs P.M._

-14&deg; last night. Winter has struck Butte at last. I'm going down town now after butter and stamps and paper and then over to the lib [sic]. You never say anything about your cold or your heart. How have you been behaving lately? Take good care of yourself and don't you dare get sick.

Flo

#### [1918 To Slim (xii)]

_Friday Night_ -

Dear Slim,

Mayden just left and I'll write a line tho' its nearly 12. Last night he was over until 2:40 glad you are having a good time. Just keep it up and stay as long as you want to. I mean all is O.K. Here so you stay and have a good time. I've been hunting rabbits in the moonlight and three times with Alford's car and big stop light. The snow is all gone, our dam is full to overflowing and has nearly dried up. Has been like summer. A letter came from your mother, no answer from Roy. All O.K. With Fox, I think. No word from Mr. Stickney. I'm going in tomorrow to try Mr. Kester. Much pkg for you. Everything that comes here is addressed to Mrs.

I'd like to have some of those noodles right now. I never got along so nicely with so little cooking before. Haven't used one of those little tanks of kerosene yet. Goodnight, Sleepy Slim. I do too. I ain't never going to let you go away again.

Ransom

Shoes? Yes. 7 1/2 W 4 or 5.

I started to churn tonight so if Florence were here she couldn't have any tream [sic] in her toffy [sic] in the morning.

#### [1918 To Tony (xii-xiii)]

_Friday Eve._

We just came home from the movies. Saw Mary Garden in "Thais". Do you know the plot of the thing? That sort of a story always makes me _mad_ – the old monastic idea that beautiful things ought to be burned or destroyed and that the love of man and woman is something impure and unholy. It isn't so, is it. Tony, I'd like to be home with you this evening. I've been sort of lonesome for you all day. Guess the only thing to do is to write to you and then sit down and make tatting with which to clothe our young son when he arrives. Do you think he will be cold, Tony? I know you will like him just as much as I will, but sometimes I wish you could trade places with me for awhile and feel that every beat of your heart was carrying food and air and warmth to something close within your body and making it grow into an individual, a little person that never was before. It gives me a queer new feeling, an exquisitely happy feeling in spite of its strangeness. You made him start to grow and next June, I'll hand him over to you as complete a product as I can furnish. I get to thinking about you and our home and how much we care and how good and dear and generous you are and how you are everything I'd want you to be, and – Oh, I can't tell you in words but I'd like to give you a hundred kisses and a big hug. I guess you know _almost_ how much I love thee.

Always your Slim.

#### [1918 To Slim (xiii)]

Sunday – 4 P.M. Dear Slim,

Last night I went to the P.O. And drew out the mail ahead of time and found a letter from my wife. Perhaps I would have suffered from that same "back tearia" [sic] if there had been no letter from you. No, no poultry has died on this ranch since Christmas. I took the census quite recently - Speckled, dirty white, black-brown, yellow- Barred Rocks, Wyandottes. Silver Laced Rose comb Leghorns, R. I. Reds. So car Buff Orps and the one that uster sit every day – all are here. Value 200^_00_^ The cow, the one with the white spot on the ride next to the fence is momma now and the way she chases Laddy around shows she intends to protect her daughter and bring her up as she thinks best. Wonderful the way you girls seem to love each other. Howdy to Judy. I'm not jealous _yet_ .

#### [1918 To Tony (xiii-xiv)]

_Sat Eve_

Dear Tony.

I am warm and snug in bed after my bath. Won't you come and lie beside me while Judy is downstairs finishing her sewing? I'll never tell her that a man was here in her room while she was gone. But alas we sleep on a featherbed and the tell tale hollow would be there, so maybe you better not come. I would like to snuggle down on your shoulder, tho', and talk.

We haven't done much today. Slept until 10:30 and then went down town to lunch with some more of Judy's friends. They are awfully good to us. This afternoon I read a fairy story At the Back of the North Wind to Judy while she sewed. It is a dear story, one we will want our family to read.

Haven't heard a word from you since last Wednesday. I'd like to know if you are all right. Of course I'm not worried – but I'd just like to know. Did the money ever come from Stickney, the old slowpoke. I hope it came. Hope you aren't worrying about things and figuring day and night with me not there to distract your attention once in awhile. Goodnight dear. I love you lots. Always your Slim. (Never your baby, or anybody's)

Sunday Eve -

This has been a full day. First and foremost I beg to be allowed to state that I attended church this morning. I had to leave as they were singing the last hymn before the sermon to go to the basement and deposit my breakfast down the sink. I didn't stay for Sunday School.

This afternoon we went thru the Zinc Plant up on Timber Butte. They are just going over the old dump heaps from the mines, and save a lot that couldn't be saved by the old methods. The stuff averages about 8% copper, 10% lead and 12-14% zinc, all out of that old slag. I'll tell you how it works when I get home. The most fun was going up on the tram car. The mill was built [to] of [sic] be operated by gravity so it is on a steep side hill. That old tram car goes up a 14% grade and it is some steep climb. Slopes 38% they say. Well, we rode up on a sort of platform with a bunch of workers, met our man at the top and he showed us from top to bottom. There are 9 departments and each one has 3 to 4 floors so you can imagine the stairs we trailed down when it came time to go home the cars had stopped running. One of the electric locomotives had just come in and Mr. Henderson asked how soon they were going out again. They didn't know but the nice young engineer looked out the window and said he would take us down to the spur where we could get a street car. So we hopped in. The thing just tore down the grade and so nice and even and not jerky like a steam locomotive. They stopped to side track several cars of ore so they could take us clear down, and were so polite and friendly but not a bit fresh. We certainly appreciated that ride. My legs are weary yet from the many stairs.

Got home at 6:30 ravenously hungry and ate a huge dinner of boiled ham, cabbage, rutabagas and spuds and just a few minutes ago Judy came in with ice cream and cake. Her brother Jake makes fun of my appetite and I do eat as much as the other three put together. I try to be dainty and proper but Judy isn't that kind and neither am I, so its eat, eat, eat.

Judy has persuaded me to stay until a week from Thursday. We'll then go to Dillon [Montana] until the following Monday and then start for home. I'm having such a good time every minute but I'll be glad to see thee, old roughneck. Don't forget me.

Heaps of love,

Florence

#### [1918 To Slim (1-2)]

Dear Slim, Friday Night

Cold here and I'm going to bed. I wrote you a note last night but it hasn't been mailed yet. All is O.K. with Jacobson. Mr. Stickney sent 500 and Kester _kindly_ lent us 200 at 10%. Mr. Mayden Sr was over today for hours and hours talking war etc. so the dishes aren't washed since Sunday. Laddy stays here even when I'm away and didn't go home with George yesterday. He was over but I didn't speak of it in last night's letter because – well I was so – well call it what ever is right. He wants peace. But he won't buy a ticket nor carry water to the elephants – wants to crawl under the tent. "Penn lied", "doubled crossed" him, "has no character" etc etc. And Toughy, you have _lied_ _to_ _me_ too. I know you have because your mother won't lie and Geo. says he did not say anything about me like the rot you were fed upon. He says he knows no reason why I am not morally good enough for Sis except that I held out too long with Lee. I told him that if he would say that to you or send it to you by your mother, I wouldn't ask for anything more. You little fibber! Here I've been blaming a great big fine Christian gentleman all this time when my own Skinny has no character at all. I'll tell you some things that will make you laugh when you get home. ~~You'd better hurry up~~, No, I don't mean that. I am a little lonesome for you, I miss you every minute, but I want you to stay as you have planned and have a good time. You see you can't get away much after this visit until mid summer. Good night to me wife, baby I mean.

Wed P.M. Dear Tony -

Got up early this A.M. And went to school with Judy. I completely lost my heart to a red headed freckle-faced little Irish man in the 1st grade. Your letters were here this noon when I got home. Tony, I _never_ fibbed to you. Its nice he has Penn to lay all the blame on, isn't it. I'm so relieved to know that all's well with Jacobson and that poky Stickney finally cam across. Did you save some for me? I'll have to borrow from Mother to get home on and buy a few baby clothes – or rather material to make them. Did I tell you that I had me pocket picked and lost pocket book, $4.80 [1919 $4.80 = 2007 $57.08] and the chain to my glasses. Makes me wad. Guess I am a baby all right, not old enough to take care of her purse. Wasn't going to tell you, but you might as well know what a boob I am, first as last. I'm going over to the Lib now, then for a swim and after supper to geology class. Wish you were here to go a' swimmin' too, but you'd have to masquerade as a girl.

Heaps of love,

Friday Eve – Dillon, Montana

Dear Tony,

Well, this has been quite a day. We got our lunch ready and with five of Miss Nashes friends (teachers) left at 10:30 for Beaverhead River [Montana] a little more than a mile from town [_Dillon, Montana_]. We had a regular old time picnic. Climbed up between two big hills, built a fire made cocoa and roasted bacon. Mr. Tone, allow me to inform you of the fact that we're going to have a picnic at Rock City[^rockCity] right sudden after I get home. Now we _are_! We climbed up quite a steep hill and had a fine view out over the valley. There was a man there at the river trout fishing and I envied him so. I slept 2 hours this P.M. While the rest went to Shakespeare Club and then one of the Normal School Seniors came and helped get the dinner for this evening. She seems to be very nice and we got acquainted quickly. Two teachers in the Normal were invited here to dinner and we knitted, tatted and played rummy all evening. I'm tired as usual now. Don't get quite enough sleep. That way sound like a joke, but it isn't. Mother gave me your last letter to read. I'll be so glad if things are fixed up enough between us and George so that Nell can come over more often. Mother says she's ashamed of me, - that I've treated Geo like the dirt under my feet. Maybe I've not treated him like a bosom friend, - but Mother is so super sensitive on the subject of G.E.M. Ransom, you said in your letter that you didn't like to feel that I had to take your word against my family's. You know that anything they may say or think about you makes no difference in my own knowledge of what you are. I don't need even _your_ "word," because I know you and dear, you know how implicitly I trust you in everything and love you. Tony, I can hardly wait for a week from Monday to come. I wish we were going straight on home day after tomorrow. The last few days have gone so slowly. Good night dear, my dear. Your wife wishes you a sweet sound sleep and I'll be there beside you, in spirit at least you dear old Tough guy, I love you just heaps and heaps and heaps.

Friday Eve

Dear Tony,

I've just finished rubbing Mother and am sort of weary. But then, its night and one is 'sposed to be tired then. Mother woke me up just _awfully_ early, at 8:30 because breakfast was all ready. We've had two trips down town. I bot the Babby [sic] a little coat and hood. Do you remember the kind Martha Alice had on the day the Ponds were out? It's like that, only white eiderdown and so warm and soft. Then I've made more than a yard of tatting to put on a flannel petticoat. I pretend to Mother that I don't care, can't see what difference it will make to the baby whether its clothes have any trimming on or not, and how glad I'll be when its grown up. And all the time I'm thinking how dear he will be when he's little. I'm still home sicker tonight than last night. Gee, but I'll be glad to be back with you again. Tony, brief separations are good things if only to make one realize the more how much they care and how lonesome they'd be if anything happened. A little more than a week more and then –! Did I tell you our exact plans before? Get back to Butte Monday Evening, leave there Friday AM reach Great Falls that afternoon and stay Saturday & Sunday. And then Monday eve we'll be together, old man.

Good night. Dearly beloved.

Always your Slim.

Slim,

Your mother wrote me a red hot one and I have just written her that when she and Geo show up as fair and right as Nell has, and after he has apologized for lies and coloring and owned some of it, all will be O.K. If she says anything ask for the letter. Geo!! She wrote me an awful one. I don't think she knows how she stings a fellow. F.F.

July – 1918 At Mrs. Woaster's, Valier

Dear Tony,

We've just been having a good laugh at Miss Tone. The blooming little rascal won't wake up and be fed, so Mrs. Woaster gave her a teaspoon full of cold H~2~O. And she just hates it. She screwed up her face and spit it out and went right back to sleep again. Without any dinner and now she'll behave tonight like she did last night – keep me awake most of the time feeding her. This is her programme.

1. – I cry 10 minutes

2. – Mrs W. Take me into the other room.

3. – My mother give me something to eat for 20 minutes.

4. I sleep five minutes.

5. I cry for ten etc.

I vary the programme by eating too much and heaving Jonah and Mrs W. calls me a little 'tinking 'ting.

You ought to see her eat, Tony. She shuts her eyes and goes right after it and gets so mad when she loses the right spot. We like her pretty much, don't we, Tough Guy.

I meant to tell you that those radish seeds are up on the shelf that has the spices, in the North part. Don't plant the package – marked Strasbeveg and we'll put them in a little later. Those others grow so big I 'spose they ought to be planted quite far apart. If you'd go to the trouble of picking them you could have a nice lot of green peas by this time. Don't you give all my precious turnips to the pigs. I just bet you're trying to get out of digging the vegetable cellar! Wonder if Pat and Patty have turned up yet. I bet Someone swiped them. Wish you could have had some of that swell fried chicken I had this noon. You be sure and get enuf [sic] to eat now, and don't you dare work too hard out in the hot sun. And be good, Tough guy, and don't forget me while I'm gone. Good bye until Tuesday Eve.

Mrs Roughneck.

Saturday P.M.

Rapid City, S.D. Tone in hospital following appendix and ventral suspension.

Dear Slim,

I hope you are not lonesome today. Daddy said you were cheerful as ever this morning. I wanted to come over this afternoon and would have come if it hadn't rained. Tomarrow [sic] I'll come, knee or no knee. It's looking for some one who doesn't come. I wonder if you rested last night and how you are feeling just now. I'm sending your pen, some paper and envelopes but do not try to write tonight. Baby is O.K. Trying to sing just now. Mother is reading Irish history. It's an awful dull day, but many brighter ones coming – camp with camp fires maybe and trout and deep shady pools. We'll plan for it.

Good night LTTT – Much love,

July 26, 1920 (1919?) - Cut Bank Camp Glacier Park

Dear Tony,

Gee, man, I wish I had taken [Peggy](#peggy) and gone on home with you and left Judy and Mrs. Johnson to camp. Peg is asleep and all covered up at last – its 6 P.M. But I spent most of the afternoon chasing flies and mosquitoes off from her and the poor kid is one mass of welts. I've doped her up several times with kerosene and it doesn't seem to do a bit of good. If they continue to be as bad as this, you'll probably get a phone call from me long before you get this letter. If you can, you'd better come after us just as soon as you get this anyway. I thought I'd sworn off from going camping without you but here I be again, so darned lonesome and restless that I could crook and and you gone only a few hours. And I feel so sorry for Peggy child. Camp is no place for a baby and I'm afraid she is going to be wretched most of the time. But the pines do smell good and the mts are clear and I'd be quite happy in spite of the flies if you were here. The gent at the chalet is grouchy as all get out. He keeps peeking in at the door every minute or two to see if we are behaving properly. 'Spose he thinks we will rob his cash register or steal a nickles worth of chocolate. Didn't even know if O'Brien was forest ranger her when I asked him. Also says fishing is absolutely N. g, that they have fished here steadily for a month and have caught only one fish that weighed half a pound. Piffle! I think something is wrong with his bean, also with the way he fishes. Well, we want to find out the time and hint for a mattress tho' I doubt if that does any good. Wish you were here.

Always your Slim

Valier – July 1920 Francis Heights

Dear Tony,

Gee, but this has been a long day. It seems like a long time since you left and here you are only as far as Great Falls – just getting in there, I imagine. I was over to Norsby's most of the P.M. with Mrs Johnson. She helped sew and I did what little I could. The funeral is tomarrow [sic] and I guess I'd better go, & then perhaps go over and spend the night with Nell. It will be my only chance as the little turkeys hatch Tuesday (Mrs Norsby's eggs) and Nell would probably feel better if I went. Then I can find out about the money too. I guess it is a good thing you didn't wait.

My tongue has gotten us into trouble as usual. Mrs Johnson was saying she had never seen or tasted a trout and I said "Well, you'll have to go up to the Park with us and I'll feed you up on trout, all you can hold." And be golly, she jumped at the invitation. She has never been there or had a vacation from her husband and kids for years, I guess, and almost the last thing she said was to ask me what kind of a dress she ought to have. She wants to get some khaki and make a real one. We'll have a room for her won't we? Just think, she hasn't been away from Valier any place – not even to the Falls, for a year and a half, and that vacation was taking care of an invalid husband in Calif. She'll be a good sport, I know, and maybe we can give her a good time. She's as crazy about the prospect as any kid.

Later – Mr Allen has milked and departed & I'm about to hitch up and go after little Esther Johnson. Peggy says "night night" to you. She's been looking for you all day. "Dadda – gone," she says.

Sunday Eve. At town on my way to Nell's . It's late as I waited to go to the little Norby girl's funeral. Nearly had the stuffin's kicked out of me last night. That Johnson girl beats even Peggy. Guess I'll wire you when I find out about the money, so you won't be delayed. Awful lonesome. I'm glad you aren't going to summer school – F.

Dear Slim,

Saturday night – 10:30. Awful pen but I'll try. I'm late getting started because of the heavy rains, but we'll be on the way Monday morning sure. Fisher is not coming with me. It seems a long time to be away from home and I'm pretty lonesome for you and Peg. If Judy arrives on schedule she will be with you Monday. I'm glad of that. The days are long and it won't be many suns 'til you'll see me coming down the hill. Next time I leave you there alone will be a long time hence. My, but I'm lonesome and this house is such a quiet place. Dad reads. Sadie and Helen are well and happy. Don not well and very thin. Jack isn't returning now or later says its too quiet for him. No news, nothing to tell you but the old news, that you are th best girl and the best wife and the best pal in the world.

Salt Lake City – Q St 1922

Before and after Rich's arrival. We came to Salt Lake from Park City, Utah where Dad had taught school. He was hired as a salesman by Columbia Savings and Loan. No car Little money. He slept by the wayside some nights.

June 1922 Sat. Eve.

Dear Tony,

There isn't anything to write about except that I sort of Like you and miss you and that isn't news. Mrs. Douglas & I have been working all day – ironing baking bread and the usual scrubbing of pants and kids. We are tired too. Didn't hear from you today. Spose you are in Hiawatha. It has been raining all day long so we had to put off the fumigating. I hope you are warm and not too tired tonight. Night dear

Always your Skinny

Sat. Eve.

Wonder if you succeeded in getting any of those Park City rough necks. I dreamed last night that you had made 25^_00_^ in one day but that was all you could squeeze out of the town. Was just reading about Milford in a U.P. Folder. Population 1300 is a division point on the U. Pacific, and a large force of men is employed there in the R.R. Shops so maybe it will be easier to work than if it were purely a farming community. This is Sunday and Peggy all dolled up and excited has gone to church with Mother. Mary sits here on the floor putting dolls to bed and draping them with pieces of pink cloth, with many squeals and grunts. Suppose she is telling them to go to sleep. Not a bit of mail to forward to you yet. Wonder where you are today, still at Park City or moving on to some other town.

This is evening and we are all glad to have a chance to cool off. Wonder if you have been tired and hot today too. Peggy is writing to you. She says "I miss you when you are away. I want you to come home tomarrow [sic]." I had to switch her little legs today for leading Mary away and she said "When I grow up I'll get a great big rope and spank you." Then she was sorry and came and wept on my knee and wanted to be hugged. This has been such a long day. Time can't sail along fast enough just now to suit me and it goes so darned slow when you are away. You'll write as often as you can won't you, Toughy, and tell me everything you have time for. I miss talking things over and hearing what you did during the day. Goodnight and lots of love.

What do you think. Mrs Douglas came in for a chat this evening and says Mrs Carlson wrote her to send her 7^_00_^ rent money to her at Park City. She says she hopes she has a little sense and will pay me tomarrow [sic].

June 26 – Salt Lake Monday Eve –

Gee, we are all wrecks tonight, but sort of enjoyed the day any way. Mary must have walked over a mile and Peggy twice that. We packed up sandwiches and milk and spent the day at the Park. There were very few people there and the kids had lots of fun rolling on the grass, watching the merry go round etc. Peg had a ride on a little horse with Mother in a seat behind her. Mary's favorite spot was the duck pond and she could hardly be dragged away to a shady secluded spot for her lunch. I wore Mother's big coat, rather warm to be sure, but it covers one up very well. We stopped down town and got a few groceries and a nice cold chocolate soda – yum yum! Mother bo't some oxfords and the clerk was quite taken with Peggy – Wanted her to come & live with him. She said "My mother takes good care of me." When we went out he asked her to come & see him again sometime and she stopped in the door way to shout "Yes, and you come down and see us sometime too."

I was all prepared to brain the mailman this morning if he didn't bring me a letter from you but luckily he did. Sure hope that Western man does get what he deserves. I'm glad Rose started a policy. She wanted to before we left but I imagine Dan discouraged it. Is anyone living in our old abode yet? Hope you can tell me soon where to write you. Have your shirts ready to send as soon as I know the address. Maybe I'll hear by Wednesday when Mother will be going down town again.

Goodnight honey. I send thee a kiss or two or three and probably you are so busy right now that you'll never feel 'em land, one on your left ear, one on your nose and one on the right corner of your mouth. Take car of yourself, Toughy. Remember it's awfully hot and you mustn't get sick away from me.

Florence

Didn't get to write to you yesterday. A letter from Joy came in the morning saying she would reach Salt Lake that afternoon so we were busy cleaning up and Mother went down to meet her. Seems so nice to have her here. She is the comfortable kind, not a bit like Judy. She and Mother are going down to hear the Tabernacle concert this noon. Peggy was quite sick night before last. After she had fixed my bed she sat up and said "You can't sleep in this bed. I don't like beds that have been vomited on. Guess I go sleep with gogga." Then she proceeded to do the same stunt on gogga's bed and announced that she didn't want to sleep with gogga but would go back to mother. She feels all OK again now guess it was just the hot weather plus a sip of chocolate soda down town.

We were so glad to get the letter from Camas. I'm sending your shirts and puttees to Provo today by insured P. Post. Do you want a suit of underwear sent too, or have you all you want to bother with? It's nice you can sleep out o'nights. We just about roast [sic] until midnight. Folks are ready to go. Good luck, honey.

_Thursday P.M._

Dear Tony,

Mother and Joy have gone down town to hear the Tabernacle organ again. Gladys has just gone home so we are at peace. Peg is much engrossed in the new picture book and Mary is loving her new doll, also from Joy, Made of bath towelling stuffed with a rubber sponge.

I'm sending along the two letters from Mary & Sadie. I'm going to take the postage money and make Mary a dress or apron or something. They do have hard luck, don't they. Rose's first payment and the balance due on the light arrived today. Shall I cash it? We'll be just as careful as we can be of every penny. Of course having Joy has made a little xtra but not much. We have had a find visit together. She is such a sensible good girl. Had quite a letter from Prof. Hubbard. Will send the first sheet with the rock tests. Who knows, it might help to make a sale for you among the post office bunch should you stop at Cleveland for a day or two.

Do you like the pictures? The others weren't extra good. Took two of these down in the Park. We all got weighed on the way home. Peggy 36, Mary 25, me 135 – Mary has gained a lot. Have a little headache and think I'll lie down while Mary is asleep. The test was O.K. At least I haven't heard any thing from it.

I love you kiddo,

Skinny

#### [1922? To Toughy (12-13)]

_Friday P.M._ - Q-Street - Salt Lake City

Dear Toughy,

Well, Joy has departed. Mother is down seeing her off now. It is a little cooler today. How are you standing the heat? The nights must be fine if you are sleeping outdoors. Joy and I went down to Loew's State last night and hit the worst bunch of vaudeville stunts you ever saw and not a very good picture either. I had a lovely pain all the way home but it departed later. It rather scared me, though, so I had mother send postage to Mary today and asked her to send the things right away. Wouldn't be surprised to have to go most any day. I was just sorting out letters in my half of the desk and ran across the Agency pictures of you. Mary was all smiles and grunts where I showed her one and when I kissed it she had to place two big smacks on your nose too.

*Where were all of your letters during this time? I either didn't keep them or they have been lost.*

Mrs Richter told mother today that a plumber would be here most anytime to fix the sink! She didn't seem to know anything about the other. You must have tried to be too tactful. She said she would speak about the disinfecting at the office and see that they wrote to Carlson about it.

It is evening now and really cool. Bet you are cold if you are camping on an old Army cot. Will one quilt be enough for your knee? Don't you want me to send you a blanket or tow? My, I wish you could come home for the Fourth, but I'm not going to think much about it as long as the chances are that you can't. Had quite a visit with Mrs Quinn and the other white haired lady today. They had two visitors from Park City, a Mrs Olsen and Mrs Jackson. They must have given a good report of us for Mrs Quinn was so _very_ friendly. The other lady at quinn lived there 20 years; no wonder her hair is snow white.

Friday P.M.

I'm sending you one night shirt to Price so be sure to call at the post office if you [are] over there. It's insured and has return address so will be all right if you aren't in Price any more. Hate to think of you these cold nights, with cramps in your old knee. We are going to have fine baked beans tonight. Fly over and get some. Going to fumigate tomorrow (bed bugs!)

Good luck to you, kid

Flo

#### [1922-10-14 To Tony (13-14)]

Dear Tony,

We got your letter this morning and mighty glad we were to hear from you. Seems as if you've been gone two or three weeks instead of days.

We are all feeling well except Peggy girl who has a bad cold again and an upset stomach. She slept with me last night and tossed and talked until 5 A.M. I had a hard time keeping her covered. It is cold here, too. We have to keep a fire going most of the day.

Went down town Thursday with the baby and had him fixed up. Mrs Garvin took care of the girls and looked after all three of them this morning while I went down to pay the light bill and returned some books that were due. Peggy is all excited over dressing Mary's 19 dolly. I got her a little shovel and pail too. Jennie is coming over to supper Monday eve so we won't have the birthday cake until next day when there will be more time for the children to play. Mr Rice was over again to see about the fumigating. The Carlsons are evidently worried because they haven't received the receipt for it, so I wrote to Mrs Carson and told her how it was - that I couldn't go with you away. There hasn't been any mail except this letter from Mother and one from the Intermoutain. Think that is our book. Do you have to sleep alone and does your knee hurt these cold nights? Wish you could fly home by aeroplane or someway when night comes. I actually had a nightmare last night. Dreamed there was a gun pressed against my ear and I felt the darned thing there when I woke up too stiff with fright to turn over. As if any burglar would ever come here! Expect Mrs Douglas will be home in a few days. I'd just as soon she was away. She was here awhile yesterday & acted peeved because we didn't know if we were going to move. Said she could have been to Colorado and back again by now etc. We should worry, tho' I do feel sorry for the poor old soul. Must get at the cleaning. Haven't done a thing yet and it is three o'clock. Write often and make it go if you can and _don't_ overdo and hurt your knee and take good care of yourself. 

Lots of love,

Florence

Mary's latest is "Oh my nose, whoa bill."^[Possibly a reference to the song [Whoa, Bill](http://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/7598/) "Whoa, Bill on the internet." by Arthur Collins and Joseph Natus? Possibly played by other bands in the area?]

Goodnight Toughy, and know that your family is thinking of you and loving you and wishing you luck. Mary and Peggy and I know you will be successful. We are your good luck pieces, too big to carry along but more powerful than any rabbit's paw in any darkie's pocket anyway.  Skinny wrote this two weeks ago to stick in your pocket when you left - and forgot it.

Nov 1 - 22 - 63 Q St

Dear Toughy,

Wish you were her this cold snowy evening. I can just imagine you with pains in your knee when you are cold & tired. Hurry and come home so I can keep you warm. We all went over to Jennie's yesterday while the fumigation was done. Mr Rice was very kind, took us over in his car & started both fires when it was over with so we had a nice warm house to come home to. Jennie came back with us and stayed for supper after which we walked up and registered. Now I can vote for your good friend Arn Evans and against that darned sheriff. Mrs Douglas is still here and we are getting along fine. The baby gained only 2 ounces last week. I'll probably have to start the bottles going soon. Peggy and Mary are both well and unusually good natured. Hope we see you soon, dear.

Lots of love,

Florence

Sunday P.M.

Dearest Tough guy,

Don't you know you've been gone only a few hours but I'm so darned lonesome for you. Mrs D. is away, the kids are asleep and I don't know what to do with myself. Sit and think about you, I guess, as I used to do at school when you were away _all_ the time. Curled my hair and powdered my nose and cleaned up pretending you would be coming in any minute.

This is such a wonderfully fine day. Hope you are enjoying your ride. How are the school maams? Behaving properly? Don't you know that you _almost_ made me feel badly because you hesitated to tell me about them?

Richard woke up then and I've held him for an hour and washed Peggy's hair so we can get a haircut tomorrow. Peggy has been one question box for the last hour. Just told her that curiosity once killed a cat and she said "Did it? Why?"

Tues Eve - 10:30 and I'm not asleep yet. Just finished making your night shirt and will send it tomorrow if I hear from you. I hope it helps to keep you warmer.We have the house cleaned up and changed around a bit. You won't know us when you come home. Guess I'll go _zu Bett^_[German for "to bed." German has nouns capitalized.]. Wish you were here to hug me and keep me warm.

Skinny

_Wed Eve_

Just finished cutting out another night shirt for you and one for Peggy. Been down town twice today laying in supplies before Mrs D goes tomorrow and then down to Dr Jeidell's this P.M. She says the rupture is repsonding just beautifully. Haven't heard a word from you yet. That mail man better not pass me by tomorrow. 

Lots of love,

Flo

Thursday P.M.

Been sewing all day. I'll mail your night shirts first time I can get down town. Mr Tone, don't you dare call me extravagant for spending so much money on cloth. I saw night shirts in Walker's window for $2.25 and not as heavy as these which cost only a dollar apiece. I'm so glad you have had two such good days. Only wish you wouldn't work so long and hard and late. I'll be glad when you are home again. Write often if only a word to let me know that you are all O.K.

Love to my Tony,

F.

Sunday Eve,

Dear Tony,

That's as far as I got last night. Mrs D. came in and wanted me to tell her fortune with cards & using an old library book. She really thinks there is something in it. There's that dark widow. That's Mrs G. and a light malicious woman, that's Mrs Quinn. I wonder if those two old hags are trying to get me into trouble. If they do I'll go right down to the Elk's Club and get them to help me etc.

Jennie came down yesterday and stayed all afternoon. Went up to Griffins last night to get Peggy and stayed for a little visit. Mrs Griffin wants me to go to church with her to hear Rev Goshen next Sunday & Mr G. offered to take care of all the kids. He'd have some bunch. They are both so nice & friendly.

Gladys hasn't been here for several days. Mrs D. found her swiping candy from the cupboard and the bold little imp was actually scared. Haven't done any work yet and there's lots to do. We are all well and lonesome.

Love,

Florence

Friday Eve, Nov 10 - ^>^22

Dear Tony,

You ought to hear the baby whimpering and coaxing for his supper. Poor kid is so hungry. The doctor surely will give me a formula for him on Monday.

Are you out in the storm this evening. It has been snowing nearly all day, melting a good deal as it came but we must have three inches on the ground now.

The kids are in bed and asleep now, thank goodness. You should have seen Mary haul off and swat Peggy a good one this evening, when Peg was trying to boss her. I took the two of them for a little walk to the meat market on O Street. Peggy saw some boxes of animal crackers & informed the clerk that she hadn't had any for years & years, so of course I had to get her some. Been sewing some today on their pajamas. Gee, kid, there's nothing to write about. Life surely loses its savor when you are away. Take good care of yourself, dear for our sakes if not for your own. Don't you go out in this bad weather and catch cold. Do your throat still sore. We all miss you so.

Love from your Skinny

*And then our Tony came home - He was doing so well that he took us all down to Price where he sold with Dawson Seuter & other salesman. Dawson took a big commission on everything he sold but we didn't know that and the company kept his commissions, we knew that by checking on folks making their payments regularly. Prise [sic] - Where the big market burned down kitty korner across the street and the sirens & all wakened Richie & frightened him so. Price - where the crippled mag pie was my pet and ate from my hand. Price - where our coal disappeared too fast so I and another neighbor marked chunks with chalk, and found them in the Greek's coal pile. Prise [sic] - where you came home one night with "red eye" on your breath and told me you all had to drink with the Italian coal miners in order to sell them - You were the only one sober enough to drive home from Scofield, Hiawatha or some of those cod camps. The other salesmen liked to work with you because people trusted you, but they made a lot of fun of you - called you the preacher because you wouldn't go with them to get a girl. As spring came, things got worse with Dawson and the office. You had made enough to buy a used car & eventually got a job selling Standard Register[\^6] - a hard thing to sell. You were working down in Southern Utah. Rich was healthy, the girls too, but your brother E. A. with TB had come to live with us. I sure worried about it but you loved that brother very much. He left a wife & 8 children in Akron, Ia.*

Dear Slim, April 8, ^>^23 - Richfield

Sunday morning, nearly nine. This town is better. Quite a lot of pavement, a live place. I believe it best to plan to come. From here I can work into a good big territory. I don't expect much from Cassidy and if you can manage with out me it will save about 25^_00_^. Plan to leave there about the 15^_th_^. Call a cab, you can't manage suit case and youngster on streetcar. I will write you each day so you'll know how things are progressing. I have asked Cassity to give you my check. Be sure to get your money on the range at Price. If after four days of hard work we can't make a go of it here, I will write or wire you. In that case we either go back to Price or you will remain in Salt Lake. So don't leave S.L. until we have it all settled. I really think you will like this place if we locate here and think of the trips we could make southward. Well, we'll see. I've got to go some from now on.

Much love to you all,

Richard

Mary, Peggy and Slim. I love you much & everlastingly,

Letter II [This letter originally appeared before Letter I]

Richfield, Utah. April 1923 (Letter II)

Dear Slim,

How's my wife tonight? You didn't seem well when I left and I'm wondering if you are all right. Write me c/o Geril [?] Del. Gee Slim, this is a fine little town. We've been walking all around it today. Rents are low and Skaggs is here. Will be able to get ahead in the course of time. Even if Cass doesn't treat us right and fix it so we can get the car. I think it best to move down here. I am going to ask you to have a talk with Mr Cassity. I'm afraid he will put us off indefinitely and we must have a car at once. This is no great favor we are asking. We want money to move the furniture from Price & 200^_00_^ to make 1^_st_^ pm't on a car. If he doesn't respond at once I shall sell for some other company and shall make regular trips to Carbon County. I don't like to ask you to talk to him but our lack of funds makes it necessary for us to force him to a statement very soon. Talk real nice to him and don't let him say tomorrow. The boys owe me on collections they have made and Jenkins owes me 22^_50_^ and there is the accrued sheet on which I have asked Cass or Dawson to settle with you. There was a bad snow storm on when we landed at Mt Pleasant. Stormed all night. I have just about sold a Standard in this town. Then I sold 1000^_00_^ B&L there next morning before train. It was late when we got here last night and today being Sunday, we couldn't work. Tomorrow we'll hit up a hard day & see if we can do some business. Will also rent one of two houses we have decided to choose between. One is 10^_00_^ per, 3 rooms, fine yard and lawn and nice irrigated garden fall plowed and clean, but house of stone not very nice in appearance. The other is, I think, 15^00^ per. nice lawn, wonderful shade, some large fruit trees in back, immense rose bushes, small garden, 4 rooms & wash room down stairs, 2 small rooms upstairs, 1 block from primary school. Both have H~2~O in kitchen, but neither has bath.

Love to thee, my lover of these past golden (not money) years

*And so we moved to Richfield, the place with the lovely roses and shrubs and the big apricot tree where the kids all played in its shade. The lady who walked from the country carrying half a dozen eggs to trade for a little coffee or sugar. She always stopped to rest on our porch and had a drink of water and a little visit. She had been a school teacher & had known Zane Grey. She was born in a soddy and a herd of cattle went over the soddy & one fell thru partially. One leg dangling over her & her mother in bed. Her mother was English & had been bro't over by a missionary. She left husband & church when he took more wives. We went to Bryce Canyon & camped over night - Esla in the tent & we in the little car. Rich cut his first tooth there. It snowed at night and the sun came out in the A.M. Bryce was a fairy land. We came home May 31^_st_^ & found people had wrecked our snow ball bush & roses & lilacs - flowers for Decoration Day! Business was nil. Cassidy hard boiled, Standard Reg. impossible to sell in these small poverty stricken southern Utah towns. Dad & Esla had to camp out in a tent & cook meals over a camp fire and then Dad had to look decent & clean & business like when he made his calls. Esla got the steaks and expensive foods. Dad the oatmeal and bread. I once caught him (Esla) feeding Rich a mouthful from his spoon. I really protested. Couldn't get our money from Cass - over $1000^_00_^ that Dad knew of positively. We took Esla way down to Durango Colo, so he could easily get to Albuquerque where his sister Mary lived. On the way, he drove so recklessly, not caring whether he died or not that I asked Tony to stop the car, I got out and refused to let the children or myself get back into the car unless Tony was at the wheel. Esla never like me. He wanted Tony to marry "Bessie" at Akron. And I never liked Esla very well. I was a little jealous, but tried to understand that he was the big brother, the fairly successful one until the TB and 8 kids caught up with him. Tony was sometimes ashamed of Roy and Milo, but never of Esla. We ran out of money entirely on the way back to Salt Lake but our Dad stopped at Price, made a B&L sale & got enough to get us to Salt Lake. I and the kids camped in the tent by a little creek on the outskirts of Ogden while he struggled with Cassity & got enough to get us to Seattle where he had the promise of a job there. Car trouble, a part to be ordered, we were almost a week late getting there. Someone else had the job! We camped for nothing in some Seattle park & it rained and rained and Tony's knee was very bad. I made Tony sell my beautiful perfect blue white diamond ring. I had _him_ so needed no ring much as I had loved it. It bought used lumber and Tony made two 1/4 acre sales at a sub division out in the woods & his commissions made a down payment on our 1/4 acre - or was it a half acre. We were too proud and maybe too foolish to ask for any welfare. There wasn't much in those days. A person had to sink or swim. There was a war on in Seattle between the Building & Loans & none would take on a new salesman who might be a spy for a rival company. He tried to sell silk hosiery and a special sort of map until a new ordinance prohibited "peddlers" and his swollen knee and leg forced him to stop. Oh Toughy, how you had to suffer for that fall you had in 1918. You know how ads for salesmen always sound so fine in the newspapers and we became acquainted with "old Whiskers" and away went my Tony to the San Juan Is. to sell groceries.*

Tues P.M. April 1, 1924

Dear Tony,

I've just had a nap and feel sort of bleary eyed & head achy. After you left this morning, I came back & did a big washing. This afternoon, I thought I'd forget my lonesomeness by going calling so we all four walked to Mrs Martins - not at home, to Mrs Kinzie's - not at home and way up to Mrs Lund's. Nobody home. By that time we were all hot and thirsty and tired and Richard refused to walk home, the little rascal. Poor kid could hardly wait to be tumbled into his kiddy koop, he was so sleepy.

Mrs Thomas came over for a little while. She suggests old man Fergusson to fix the chicken coop. He does odd jobs and probably wouldn't charge so very much. The first time you come home, let's eat Alec [the rooster]. I'll look forward to that every time I feed him. I'm so glad you had such a fine day for your trip up there. Didn't you enjoy it? Does the country look anything like the Skookum Chuck[^skook] stories sounded?

[^skook]:> Skookumchuck Chinook Jargon that is in common use in British Columbia English and occurs in Pacific Northwest English. Skookum means "strong" or "powerful", and "chuck" means water, so skookumchuck means "rapids" or "whitewater" (literally, "strong water"). It can mean any rapids, but in coastal usage refers to the powerful tidal rapids at the mouths of most of the major coastal inlets.

There wasn't any mail except one of those chain prayer letters promising great joy if I copied it and sent to ten of my friends and great misfortune if it was passed by. I chucked it. The other was a letter from "Earnestly yours, George R Williams" hoping you had some business for him etc

Wed A.M. Cold & windy here. I hope you are good and warm. Write as soon as you conveniently can.

Good luck, honey.

Lots of love,

Florence

*"Alec" was the mean rooster. We had bo't a dozen red hens and this horrible rooster who attacked like a whirl wind. Tony used to hold him down with his head in a puddle until he nearly drowned. It wasn't safe for a child to go into the chicken yard. I was afraid of him too. Until we had a little chicken coop & yard we left them where we had bo't the chickens and I went up each day to feed them and gather the eggs. The lady - part negro, part Hawaiian & very nice was a cook down town but her old grey haired husband was at home. One day a little 5 year old neightbor girl walked up there with me. The old man followed us out to the hen house & as I leaned over to get an egg from the nest he tried to put his hand down inside my dress to my breast. This child's mother was known as the worst gossip in the neighborhood and the kid's eyes were curious and alert. What could I do? I didn't dare slap his face but must have glared at him and he stammered "How, how could I help it when I could see right down there!" I guess that is the only time any man ever tried to get fresh with me. I told Tony when he came home and at first he wanted to do something about it. He wasn't going to have _his_ _wife_ insulted. But we decided to ignore it and hurried to get our own little chicken coop built. We nearly broke our backs digging out all the alder stumps and finally had a wonderful garden. Mr Hoover (1^_st_^ cousin of Herbert's) gave me some strawberry plants and I planted them four times before they suited my lord and master, the perfectionist. I got a little huffy then but he just laughed and called me his little devil.*

Dear Slim,

Arrived O.K. just a little while ago. The car got hurt a little - radius rod (steering gear) has to be replaced. So we can't go out until tomarrow [sic]. I'll be expecting to hear from you tomarrow [sic] night and will get my mail here for awhile. Shall probably work all the islands from here. Maybe the summer cottage idea will work out. Mr Litsey (sales manager) thinks it is just the thing. Better run an ad each Sunday in The Times when you can afford it. Just make it brief and mail it to The Times Adv office. Send 1^_00_^ and tell them to return balance. Keep it up each week. Try most to sell the back 1/4 acre. 350^_00_^ easy terms 100^_00_^ down, even 50^_00_^ and 15^_00_^ per month. I guess you'll get your check from Portland all right.

I got the cook and the officer together & got their order (if I get it OKed by the Supt at Bellingham. But it isn't certain 'til I can see the Supt. I think we'll do well here.

Much love always,

Dear Slim,

Just got in. Changed tire 4 times and had 3 blow outs. I must leave the car here & go out to Lopez with out it. How I'll make it, I don't know, but under the circumstances I'd better go on and work until I get another check, then if necessary I'll come back after the car. It will cost 12^_50_^ & .50 perday to get it out of the garage when I return. I'm glad I'm out and at it even if expenses run high. It will be tough work without my whole sample case. Write me at Lopez Is. That looks the best. I hope I never have to work these islands again. Take care of yourself.

Love,

Wednesday Eve. April 2

Dear Tony Beloved,

A car just went by and Richard is at my knee all excited, saying "Cah - daddy. Cah daddy" and Peggy remarked sadly that it almost makes her tears pop out because you aren't coming home tonight. We all miss you so. I am enclosing the mail that came this noon. There were also letters from the university Bank saying your pm't was due and a bill from Smith's for 29^_00_^. The check to Varsity Motors went out this A.M. So no doubt the bank has the pm't by now. Too bad the house "refuses to pay the 25^_00_^ here but Smith will simply have to wait and we can get along all right.

Crane came this afternoon after the shovel, ax and the big saw. Says they are opening up another tract and need the tools. I'm glad the Swiss baker's fork & ax are here. Crane makes me tired. Says I ought to have one man at home and one on the road, that that's what his wife used to tell him. I told him I couldn't find another like you and that second best didn't appeal to me at all. The poor simpleton!

Your suit didn't come today but probably will show up tomarrow [sic]. Mrs McIntyre hatched 35 chickens and is quite elated.

I have read all of Marie Corelli's Life Everlasting[^corelli] this afternoon and evening. Lots of truth in it and lots of chaff too. Anyway, I know you and I are going to continue to love each other after we die and who knows, maybe we _did_ love each other in some other life too!

[^corelli]:> [**Marie Corelli**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Corelli) (1 May 1855 – 21 April 1924) was a British novelist. She enjoyed a period of great literary success from the publication of her first novel in 1886 until World War I. Corelli's novels sold more copies than the combined sales of popular contemporaries, including Arthur Conan Doyle, H. G. Wells, and Rudyard Kipling, although critics often derided her work as "the favourite of the common multitude."

Just going out to sell 'em. How are you all? I wish it was so I could come home today for over Sunday. But we "kawn't due it." Anyway we're going ahead now little by little. Yesterday the boss stayed at the hotel. It was cold and rainy and he had correspondence to take care of. I made $118/y +. Well, must go. Mr H. sent you $7.50. not 25^_00_^.

We'll see what develops. Mr Litsey thinks we needn't worry. I think I can get more next week! And I'll try awful hard to send you some of my allowance early next week. Take care of yourself.

Friday Harbor - April 6, 1924

Dear Slim,

2 P.M. and dinner over and a long political argument. I attended the Pres. Sunday School and church service. Seems pretty lonesome around here today. I've been so busy of days and so tired at night that the only times I've really felt awful homesick were first thing upon waking in the morning. I have been that tired o' nights that I fell asleep in two minutes or less. It's hard work. Last night was the first time I got to bed before 12, I guess. You generally have 2 or 3 places to return to after supper. How are you all is what I keep wondering. Well, surely we aren't always going to live this way. But its best for now and we'll follow the prescription and take it. What we are after finding out right now is whether or not it will pay and pay big enough to make it the thing to do. I believe I can average 10^_00_^ per day while here on this island - may do better. This I have found out, is a "choise [sic] territory." But they haven't or won't explain nor guarantee any definite commissions. All I know about it is that they vary from 8% to 40% and might average 15%. Should average from 12 1/2 - 15%. If my percentage has averaged 12 1/2, I have so far made about 50^_00_^ in the 4 days. Litsey leaves Tues. and then I'll very soon find out all about my future hopes in P.B. Inc. Anyway we know its the best for now and maybe we'll continue to think so for a year or even ten. However, it must pay more than 50 per week or we'll never get any where. I really think I can make it pay about 400 after I get a 'go in' and that ain't too bad as the captain says. I'll try to manage the advance commissions in such a way as will get us by nicely and at the same time not make them distrust me. You write me just how you are and how you are going to manage ~~and~~ so I can bear on just as much as needed. If you must have money I will just write the office that I am sending you $_  _ and must have more for myself. But of course I can't do this until I have shown them I can get the business after Litsey leaves.

Three of your letters have reached me. Yes, I believe that Mr Ferguson can fix the hen house for you. Better run an ad each Sunday & sell the back lot for 250^_00_^ cash or 400^_00_^ on terms. I believe it will be better to plan to stay at home this spring and then maybe later on we can ~~plan~~ arrange to get a furnished house where I am working. But you see there are many islands that I am to work and you couldn't move so often. I am going to try to get three on this island in a month, then ship to the mainland and run home, maybe leave the car at home while I work the small islands. I believe there are 4 large enough that I will need the care. You have rec'd the ^$^7.50 check by now. Maybe more will soon come from Salt Lake, but its not sure so state your needs and I will hold them to their promise. We've got 45 - 7.50 coming right now if we need it. So you and S. Hill don't get along? He likes to joke, doesn't mean anything. Wonder when he will ever get the balance we owe him. He expects it soon. The 1/4 acre will sell all right and that will fix things up. I think you might as well ask Mr F. to put in a front door, not over 7^_00_^ - that is when we can get it. Mr F. can do the work all right. It's a short job and you need the door. Then put the back door in the bedroom partition and the red front door at the back.

Don't overdo in the garden and when you are lonesome take the kids and go somewhere. Love to Margaret and Mary and Richard. I'd like to see you right now. And all to your own dear self, Slim. Thou art all I have and all I need and all I want - except the minor things.

  <p class="fauxUnderline">Friday Harbor - Monday P.M. Apr 7-^>^2~~2~~4*

Dear Skinny,

Time for bed. How air you annie way? [sic] I haven't had any mail since Saturday, the P.O. being closed when I got in tonight. Well, the doctor told me tonight that 2000 per month would average better than 300^_00_^ wages. That means if a salesman averages 100 per day he should make 375^_00_^ per month which isn't too bad.

We have worked 5 days now and sold about 700^_00_^ better than 100^_00_^ salary at that rate. Of course I won't do as well alone. I expect to be here at Friday Harbor until May 1^_st_^ [.]

Today I ran onto [sic] an old English camp of 1860-72 on this Island when the "54:40 or fight"[^oregon] stuff was on. It was a great camp - must have been. The bldgs and all are there yet, even to the officer's pool tables. Wish you could see it. And today? Found something that kids fair to be far worse - a big fine summer camp and girls. This Is. looks just like Scotland did last time I was there. 'Night T. T. I'm weary.

[^oregon]:> The [Oregon boundary dispute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_boundary_dispute), or the Oregon Question, arose as a result of competing British and American claims to the Pacific Northwest of North America in the first half of the 19th century. Both the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA) had territorial and commercial aspirations in the region as well as residual claims from treaties with Russia and Spain.[1] The British knew the region as the Columbia District, a fur-trading division of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), while Americans referred to it as the Oregon Country. The broadest definition of the disputed region was defined by the following: west of the Continental Divide of the Americas, north of the 42nd parallel north (the northern border of New Spain and after 1821 of Mexico), and south of the parallel 54&deg;40' north (the southern border of Russian America after 1825).

    > The Oregon Dispute became important in geopolitical diplomacy between the British Empire and the new American Republic. In 1844 the U.S. Democratic Party, appealing to expansionist sentiment and the popular theme of manifest destiny, asserted that the U.S. had a valid claim to the entire Oregon Country up to Russian America at parallel 54&deg;40' north. Democratic presidential candidate James K. Polk won the 1844 election, but then sought a compromise boundary along the 49th parallel, the same boundary proposed by previous U.S. administrations. Negotiations between the U.S. and the British broke down, however, and tensions grew as American expansionists like U.S. Senator Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana, or Congressman Leonard Henly Sims, Missouri, which urged Polk to annex the entire Oregon Country north to the parallel 54&deg;40' north, as the Democrats had called for in the election. The turmoil gave rise to slogans like **"Fifty-four Forty or Fight!"** and the catchphrase "Manifest Destiny".

    > The expansionist agenda of Polk and the Democratic Party created the possibility of two different, simultaneous wars, because relations between the United States and Mexico were deteriorating following the annexation of Texas. Neither Britain nor the United States really wanted to fight a third war in 70 years. Just before the outbreak of the war with Mexico, Polk returned to his earlier position on the Oregon boundary and accepted a compromise along the 49th parallel as far as the Strait of Georgia. This agreement was made official in the 1846 Oregon Treaty, and the 49th parallel remains the boundary between the United States and Canada west of Lake of the Woods, other than the marine boundary which curves south through the Haro Strait (settled over the Rosario Strait in 1872) to the Strait of Juan de Fuca and so excludes from the United States Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. As a result, much of Point Roberts (a small peninsula extending south into the Strait of Georgia from Canada) is an exclave of the United States.

Dear Slim,

Just got in. "The Doctor" left this A.M. I didn't get 100 today - 99.57. Just about 800 in 6 days of which Litsey took 265^_00_^. So I have made only about 80^_00_^ so far. I do not think Ritsey has much confidence in me. But I should average 100 per day, he will feel differently . Did you get the 7.50 check?

Those profile pictures are good. Tell the girls I was glad to hear from them and I will write them as soon as I can. I can't finish here short of 5 or 6 _wks_, Then I go to Lopey Is. I'll be home to pick _my_ strawberries. I think I'll finish Lopey, then skip to Orcas and Bellingham. But I really should finish the Islands before leaving. We need the money. If I can just average 390^_00_^ per month it will be worth all the grief I'll have to go thru. It won't be so bad on the mainland, but won't pay so well. Good night & lots of love. The wishbone of the car was bent all out of shape in unloading. It cost only ^$^1.25.

Apr 9. 148.91 today. How are you. I'll get some money for you or find out why. Hope you are getting along all right but am sure you need money. It seems mighty good to get your letters each day. That was a good picture of Bryce Canyon you sent. My, I wish so much that you could be with me on this trip. We been working the west shore today. Could see Vancouver. Sidney and Victoria must be fine. From the west light house it would be pretty at night.

Can't say when I'll get home. I want to make 1000^_00_^ clear by July 1. Do you think I can? Of course, you do. Are you afraid at night? Is that what you mean? I hope not and I think you are perfectly safe there. The main thing is not to get sociable with anyone you would be afraid to meet alone. But you needn't fear anything Slim.

The little picture is Mary and the big picture is me. We tried to take a picture of Richard and he wouldn't hold still. Aline came to play with me today. We went for a walk down in the woods.

Goodbye & love,

Peggy

_Sunday Eve_

Gee, I feel as if I'd walked a hundred miles today. It was so warm and sunshiny they all wanted to go. Richard is a regular little sport. Tramped thru the woods from 56^_th_^ to 58^_th_^, up and down a lot of little by paths. He can clamber over logs and dodge branches as well as Mary. Then when Richard was asleep, I left the girls and looked for trilliums [type of lily flower] and wild bleeding heart [Dicentra eximia] with Aline. So I ought to sleept tonight too. It's awfully hard to sleep soundly when you are gone. I'm not afraid but on the alert every minute.

Mr Parkinson asked about you today. Mrs P's married sister lives at Roach Harbor on San Juan Island. Albert Ross came over this A.M. and said "Your dad busy? My dad, he use him." so you got out of a strenuous day's work by being away. I'm going to bed. Do tell me how you like the work and all about it. My, but I'll love to travel along with you.

A card from Mary says Hugh has the measles, so she knows how to sympathize now. I tried to cut profiles of the kids. If you'll hold them up close to the wall, they are almost as good as a photograph.

Dear Slim,

Cold as Greenland again today. This makes the 4^_th_^ day of this cold. I'm now at the south end, of the island. Have taken up my abode with a family on a ranch and I expect to be here about 2 weeks. Then I'll go to Orcas or Lopez. It might be that I won't get home until about July 1^_st_^, unless you think best for me to run home some Sunday after I get thru with the large Islands and can ship the car to Bellingham. I guess that is best for I would lose only one day. It is the bad feature about this job. So Smith wants his money. Guess we'll have no trouble getting our 50^00^ per week advance.

Are you all O.K. I'm fine except for a bad cold. Soon the weather will change - maybe. If I didn't have my heavy woolens along I'd never stand the cold up here. It's piercing and searching. Did you get the hen house and the water pipe fixed? And the front door changed and the cistern in. Never mind the basement for now. But get the big stump out. You can get Mrs Hoover or Mrs Thomas or Mrs Mc to help you.

Hello Margot and Moie and Fat. I'd like to be home today and see you all but I can't come home today. A little later I'll come just as fast as the old car's wheels can turn and then I'll see you all again.

Love from Dad

Well Mrs _ _ , I got 216.61 yesterday - thats 734.45 in 4 days. It will average better than 30^_00_^ per day. I can sell on any old route just as well as Litsey - That is a I think I can. I am going to 300 some day next week. I need the 50^_00_^. Soon my only best wife will get into a home or fix up the one we have. But I must keep after it and by next fall we can wipe out the 1500^_00_^ we owe in small bills and large ones. Did the co. send you another 7.50. I sent you one check for 7.50. Write me often & don't over do. Be calm, patient, trusting loving and obedient and trade with Parks Bros. Guess I'll come home about May 1^_st_^, maybe.

Love R.

Dear Slim -

Didn't write you yesterday - too busy & too tired at night. This was my hardest day but got 149.87 Better not write me anymore here. I'm leaving in about 3 days for some other island.

Now, quit the carpentry & have Mr F. do it. Those boards are too heavy for you. Glad all are well. Will write you each day and as soon as I get next check I'll send you some money. I have so little on hand I can't send any now.

Good night dear - Love & lots of it. Ransom

#### [1924-05-05 To Toughy (32)]

Monday Eve - May 5 - '24

Dear Toughy Beloved,

This is one night I _am_ _rather_ tired. It is some job taking those kids down town, and the worst of it is that I'll have to take Margaret back again next week. He opened the abcess and it doesn't seem to hurt her so much now. I got Fatty a little white crash hat and he looks so cute in it. Got new brown play Oxfords with heavy soles for the girls, at a bargain, only 1^_00_^ apiece. They surely needed them too. If it isn't one thing, it is another to buy for children. The girls must have hats and more socks next. Mary had a big cavity filled at the dentists, too.

This is Tuesday P.M. and almost supper time. I've watered the garden and the flowers with Hoover's hose and finished sticking the peas and set out pansy plants from Mrs Thomas. Now there is nothing left to do in the garden except _hoe_, and I really like to. The corn we planted is up. We'll have our first batch of spinach tonight.

Darned cat got another big incubater chicken last night. It isn't Buster, I guess, but a big gray and white cat that has been living on chicken all over the neighborhood. Mr Hoover set a big steel trap for him last night and we'll try again tonight. Only eight chickens left altogether. Isn't that horrid?

I got your letter this morning. I'm glad too that you weren't humble with "Old Whiskers". Was awfully surprised that he came across with 15^_00_^ for me. Hope I get my regular 7.50 again without having to remind him.

Must get the fire built and supper started. Will you be home when you are thru with Lopez? Hope so. Don't work too hard, honey. You are putting in too long hours, I know.

Lots of love,

Florence

#### [1924-05-11 To My Little Girl (32-3)]

Port Stanley, Wa, May 11, 1924

Well, how's my little girl today and how are the youngsters? It is a week since I left you. In another week or 10 days I should be through here and ready for other fields islands or other. I notice that someone down at the office wants to meet me, probably Huntting and probably in the matter of territory. I have had no letters from you since the two sent at once last Tues. or Wed. No doubt there is a letter from you at Port Stanley, which is about 3 miles from here. I guess the strom has blown over and while I'm sorry it had to be, yet I think it pays to treat 'em rough sometimes, especially if you know your ground. That mizer [sic] down there knows now that Litsy didn't know and I believe he thinks more of me than if I had meekly taken the loss of time and all, and let him slip back on his generous promises. And before I am through on this Island he will feel better if not entirely all right. If I had apologized they would never have respected me. If I didn't need the job and want pretty much to stick I'd ~~never have~~ demand full pay for the last time, not less than 100 per week. They may make an adjustment but of course I can't afford to ask it. A year from now we won't feel it.

This is Mother's Day and I must write home. E.A. seems to be losing his nerve. Did you notice? I'm tired today. Got 195.68 yesterday - Love Ransom

PT Stanley

#### [1924-05-14 To Slim (33-4)]

May 14^_th_^ Dear Slim,

Got Several of your letters last night and altho' tired, enjoyed them all. Glad to hear from Margaret and Mary too and will write them when there is time. This is a cloudy morning. We had rain yesterday. Take care of yourself and don't let the garden drive you.

Sorry you lost your chicks but it means less work for you. Would have Buster killed if he's guilty.

Tut finally sent you 15, did he. My, he is tight. No, I wouldn't quit now or ever for a year if I get good territory, unless I could get very good pay and at home with the Palmer Co. Am I to write them or just wait and see? I notice in other reports that 180^_00_^ is a big day in some territories. If that is so, I shall not be able to stay with it. We'll see. Tell Judy to write the Y.W.C.A Tell her I'll do anything I can for her.

And now good morning - Breakfast is ready. Love to you all and don't you worry about me. I'll be home when I finish the work on the islands, maybe week from Saturday - Love Ransom

*So Tony came home and "Whiskers" came from Portland to see him and talked Alaska and big money and said he was going to etc. And off he went. The children and I went down to the wharf and watched the big liner take off with our Dad on it. I wonder what the children thought. I felt like the most deserted woman in the world. Alaska was so far away and three months such a long time. You left us a lot, Tony, during those years but you didn't know what else to do and always had high hopes of money and better times for all of us. The kids and I went back to our little two room house, to our garden, to the wasps that built a nest in the rough ceiling, laid her eggs and stung the big garden spiders to provide food for her children. I was to have 7.50 per week from the company, supposed to feed, clothe, pay water and electric bill etc. Real generous! Every time a boat from Alaska came in there was mail from my sweetheart I planned to take the kids and visit Nell & Mother for a month.*

#### [1924-05-30? To Skinny (34-5)]

Friday, Just after lunch - June 2^_nd_^ ? [The first Friday of June 1924 is on the 6^_th_^ but the next letter is on a Thursday and the letter after that is on the 10^_th_^ so it seems likely this letter was on May 30^_th_^]

Dear Skinny,

Well, how's my girl today? I never wished you could be along with me quite so much before at any time, I guess. Soon you will be going the other way and I want you to stay just as long as you can. In all probability I'll go on up to the extreme N.W. and then work back. I think we should do well. Mr Woods and Mr It. don't seem to make a great hit with each other. I saw Woods "Kepple report card" and he sold 660^00^ in April, 17 days of work. We had 2097^_00_^ in the same month - 18 days. So I'm not worried about losing the Alaska territory. Mr H. says if you would move up here he would be very pleased to have us stay here. We will of course do what is best for Slim Tone & Co. Plan to go to Valier, then you won't have time to get lonesome.

The storm is over and most every one is up and around again. Early this A.M. about 3:30 I guess, we ran into a high wind storm and rain. The water was not just rough but rolling at times and would break over the bow and scare everybody in. She didn't quite stand on end but almost for about three hours. About 2/3 of those aboard were sick. I ate light and came through without a cramp, pain or single wish to die.

Today I've been sitting around, not even reading. My armchair psychology and philosophy take so much of my time, you know. Well any way, too much data and ~~mental~~ measurements put into one's mental excursions would have spoiled some of the best speculations and most perfect analyses I've ever made.

How are the children? Hey Richard! You rascal! How's your tooth Richard pulled, Margaret? Mary, you top at, trying to scare me. Love to you all . I'll mail this at first stop and then write you again. Beautiful up here. Water quiet and smooth Islands green and wooded. Wish I had a kodak [A photography company] and you.

#### [1924-06-05? To Mrs Roughneck (35-6)]

Cordova. Thurs Eve. 8 o'clock

My dear Mrs Roughneck,

Just got in. We arrived at Cordova 5 PM and I went out and made a sale. Wasn't that stupid of me when I've got such a big stomach sore on my lip and a voice like Louis Schreder on Lopez Is. Going on to Seward on the Northwestern but it will be late tonight when we leave here. I've been talking with many nice people on board. The purser is a splendid fellow and so are they all on this boat. The pilot is an unusual sort and I've spent hours with him. Dad Shylock and Woods have been having many words and Woods says he is going to stop here. My, the old man is a hard old character. He is not always truthful - and selfish, he is more than that. Say, he wouldn't offer his chair or blanket to a poor old gray haired sea sick lady - unless he was reasonably certain she was too far gone to answer and accept the offer. He's a bear, a swine, everything. And he's conceited and stubborn. Imagine my surprise when he asked me to help him change the manual. He said he knew I was getting the business without using the manual and wanted my criticism. I said first it minimizes the intelligence of the average person 2^_nd_^ it is too long and detailed. It will not work in Alaska, so we are writing another. But of course he will do most of it. Well, why do I write so much that is neither here nor there? How are my four tonight? Gee, I'd give a lot to have you along with me. A boat trip for you and me down the Yukon next year. What do you say? But who'll take care of Fat and Peg and Moie. I'm to go down the Yukon in a small boat next year working from Eagle to Fairbanks. If I don't fall out with Huntting I'll get the Alaska territory next year. It would be impossible to take the youngsters on such a trip, and H. wants me to take a man with me. I'd rather take a man and his wife and you. - Two small boats. Well, its fun to think maybe you can go. Now I guess I'll go outside and walk a little. The sun is very high yet and quite warm altho' there is snow and lots of it all around in the mountains.

Ketchikan, Al - June 10 - '24

Dear Slim, It is pretty late to write you but I hear the boat at the dock leaves for Seattle tomarrow P.M. I just got in and am a little tired. I rec'd the glasses and also your good letter. I am sorry if you and Margaret get that lonesome. Being separated is not the natural way or the best way in all families. The pictures weren't too bad.

When you get returns from Brown (we never did) better skip along to Valier. I have a next summer's launch trip all planned for us five. If I can make enough to buy the boat. Once up here I don't think you would ever want to live in Seattle, S. Lake or Valier again. Love to all. R.

#### [1924-06-12 To Skinny (37)]

Ketchikan - June 12

Hello Skinny, there's a boat tomarrow. How's my girl? I'm not quite so tired tonight. Got in before eight. Didn't do so awful well today but made expenses and about 15^_00_^ more which ain't too bad. Say, do you know I'm jinged [sic] if I didn't go and make 35.44 yesterday. But just as soon as I got 'em woke up when Sky says we are off to Fairbanks Sunday and won't get back until Sept. I've been talking this whole evening and most of the night with Huntting. I asked for an office or store or boat or crew or nearly everything I could think of just to let him know I was looking around the corner a little and he comes across with a great line and says Litsey has failed & I am the one he wants to count on to train men. Now what do you know about that. And how long do you suppose he will keep me grinding away before the change. Well, I cannot continue many years at this pace 11 last night. Closed east sale at 10:15, ate supper after that. Tired all day today. Should be some mail from you tomarrow or Sat. Guess I'll hit the ridges now, for I'm tired. The noise music won't disturb me tonight. It goes on 24 hours - 6 times a week. Dreams of you, dear one. Only 96 more days to get me.

Love to Margaret and Mary and Richard "racal" [sic]. Keep smiling, get your hair bobbed, try to collect from Brown remember your promise about the Valier trip, buy your coffee and prunes from Parks Bros. and I have no doubt of your success. And now with our very best - Love, R.

#### [1924-06-13 To Slim (38)]

Ketchikan - Friday June 13 - 24

Dear Slim, Raining a little. It has been awful hot. Wish I didn't have to go out any more but I have 4 appointments after 5 o'clock. Huntting seems to have quit trying here. Some days he hasn't sold anything & he wants to move on north. From what I have heard it will be worse up there. Just for fun I trailed him and found the people all riled up against him. I make about 30 calls and the law of averages does the rest. If I had the pep to stand it I could make 40^_00_^ a day but I simply can't. I am going to sell 200 tonight, I think. And tomarrow I suppose old Sky will wake me up as usual at 6 A.M. and want the collections so he "can back them today. In the fall I think I'll try to make a change unless I am promoted. The boss is worried and has told me a great deal in confidence and asked me not to tell "even the good little wife." Well, I came up here to rest and here I am writing to you. But you are always a restful color. Got your hair bobbed yet? Any word from Brown? How are the youngsters? Well, see you again tomarrow or Sunday. Much love, Ransom

#### [1924-06-15 To Slim (38-9)]

9 A.M. Sunday June 15 - 24

Aboard the Jefferson,

Dear Slim, Well, I am leaving Ketchikan too early to get the mail that must be there and will now be forwarded to Fairbanks. The Jefferson left at 3 this A.M. and we shall arrive at Juneau tomarrow [sic] at about 4 A.M. Two days there and then to Fairbanks. I have rec'd two letters from you. Glad you have your dress & I hope you will stock up and get ready for your trip even if it seems a little uncertain so far. I sent E.A. 5^_00_^ but it is hard for me to part with much cash now. Don't overdo trying to make those Three rows of strawberries grow. The victrol is singing Oh Susana and between chorus and met the banjo comes out with great zest that makes you see that freckled kid, eyes a bulge, stuffed cheek and ridged forehead. I'm tired. Haven't done, very well so far but I can go faster and maybe accomplish more now that Shylock is stisfied. Yesterday he wanted to work with me 50-50 "to help" me. We made 9^_00_^ each. I could have made 30^_00_^. I consider hime a very poor salesman, far inferior to Litsey. He is thick skinned bungling, no tact no judgment. Talks loud & long & shows a deep streak of insincerity. He is slow mentally. He eats some in his own room. In short he is not likeable. I told him of my experience with the Standard Register and that I was no longer of a mind to help finance any company. Therefore sill [?] I had averaged less than 25^_00_^ per day I had to have a guarantee for the summer. And I got it! Shy say the reason he hasn't done well is because he is out of practice. Rats! His gas tank is carrying too high pressure. Keep acct of the storage, O'Connell etc. that you pay. And ask Ms Kune for a statement. Esla seems down hearted doesn't he. I wish I coulddo more, but his youngters are no more to be considered than ours. Grace would leave hime to starve, I suppose. I want to pay up the Moose dues.

Now Mrs S. F. T. I am going to make more in sales on this trip than Huntting does. I've decided that. Write often. Love to the girls and Richard and my Slim girl. Take care of her won't you. R.

#### [1924-06-16 To Slim (39-40)]

Still on the Jefferson -

Monday June 16 -

Dear Slim,

Half hour tops for lunch so not much time to write but I want to tell you about the glaciers. We are now walled in by high Mts - with some very large glaciers, hundreds of feet thick hanging out over or into the water. They have been blowing the whistle some to try to break off an iceberg. Such an echo I never heard before. The sound lasts and returns the 8^_th_^ or 9^_th_^ times. Icebergs by the thousands, gree blue, some of them of great size are all around us. It is raining and cold. The water is of very dark grey green shade. When I come up here again, you are to come too. My! What a trip for us together. Well, we'll see what develops. I have warded off all offers from Shylock and left him with the one thing to think about. That is that I don't finance any more ventures for any firm and it will take more than just a selling job to interest me, even if it pays better than I expect. We might as well face facts and I might as well tell you now that after losing about 1/4 of the time as I expect to do on the trip, I can't hope to save 5^_00_^ a day for the 100 work days of the 4 months. This is no money at all for the work it is. If I handle a crew in here next year on salary and commission, then we can make some real money. Shylock is not like Litsey but is deceptive, wooden, penurious. I dislike him and only hope I can outsell him, and I think I can. He wouldn't tell the truth anyway. Lunch over. We are nearing Juneau. So long, pal. I'm packing up my night shirt shaving outfit, toothbrush, etc. Ransom

#### [1924-06-18 To Slim (40-2)]

Ice Straits - Aboard the North Western to Seaward.

June 18. 10 A.M. Wednesday.

Dear Slim, They say we'll soon be sick. But rough water doesn't affect me. She's rolling some & many are heaving. Came aboard the N.W. at midnight and left Juneau at 2 A.M. Sat. we arrive at seaward & then Wed or THurs. at Fairbanks. Then I'll hear from you. Have had only 2 letters so far.

After Lunch. Not sick yet. We are out of sight of land now and rolling much worse, and upending like a Te (how to [sic] you spell teeter totter.) Sea sickness is a state of mind. All sickness, disease, sin and wrong are in the mind only. They are imaginary and conceivable only in a degree proportionate to our weakness. This great truth is especially true of a certain error of thought called sea sickness.

I am not fooling away much time, this will assure you, but am spending spare moments in reading in the library. I said moments for this is a hard place to get half an hour to oneself. Everyone seems to want to talk. I had company in my stateroom until 3:15 this morning and an interesting pair too. When I drink coffee at night I can talk from North Dakota to Utah and back. And when I get home and coffeeed [sic] up I ought to be able to tell you quite a lot about this trip. It's great Mrs Trueblue. Expensive and uncertain but wonderful. We'll hope it will pay back something a little more edible though than scenery and good fellowship. Most of the people on board this boat are high class and unlike the gangs who roae the Jefferson and the Alameda. Bet I'll have six letters from you on arrival at Fair banks next week. How are you, anyway? Wish you would send me more prints of you and the youngsters. Say, I sold that famous Five in ONe yesterday. WHen you have a chance please wrap it up like we used to do them and send it out P. Post collect. Make the total cost postage included. 3.75 - or if the postage is more than 50, add it to the 3.25 cost & send collect to Mrs J.T. Foster, Juneau, Al. Rockland House 

Chapter II. June 18 - Late P.M.

Dear Mrs Skinny, I am not feeling xtra good. Some thing I ate, I guess. It ain't sea sickness because I don't get that way. But right back of my nose is a sort of a half pain and I feel like I'd eaten some coed whale oil or rattlesnake soupeconsumé [sic] or Utah Coal Camp Mulligan like we used to get at Helper and Price. I've got to be more careful about my eats. Well, I went out Monday after arriving at Juneau and between 4 PX and our regular closing hours made between $8 & $9. Yesterday I had bad luck & last 2 big orders but I made 22.95. It seems too bad to jump up and run away from the business, as we are doing. Last night I got hold of Father Shy's book and imagine my surprise to find he hasn't done anything. He hasn't sold 300^_00_^ of goods yet, and I don't think he will. He cannot sell in Alaska because he thinks all men inferior to him. But I think this is enough on this particular subject. Mr Woods is leaving us at Cordova. He & H. had woids [sic] this A.M.

My, I'll have so much to tell you that I can imagine myself talking to the darkness many nights so often caught you doing. How are the girls and Rich. My goodness, how this old boat does roll. Gives a fellow an awful headache and makes you sort of dizzy headed. I'll bet there's a lot of 'em sick now. I'm not moving around much on account of being up so late last night and also because of something I ate. So I don't know how others are feeling at this time. But the purser said that of the 143 girls and women 143 were pretty sick or had been sick or were expected to be sick at any moment. If you were here, my dear, you would surely weep much tears in tender sympathy and genuine admiration for the brave and manly way I'm taking this cursed affliction R.

#### [1924-06-24 To Slim(42-3)]

Just getting into Valdez. June 24.

Dear Slim, This I think will be the last letter I can get to you until about July 15. This far up the boats run less frequently. How are you today? I was thinking about you and the youngsters and my relation with Parks and the Alaskan territory just about all night. At 12 o'clock I read a newspaper by daylight out on the deck. There was a ball game at Cordova while we were there. It finished at 10:15 P.X. I slept only a little and I don't feel very well today. No news to write you, and I've told you several times that I could really enjoy the trip if you were along with me to share the whales and all. I wrote you quite a lot about plans for next year. Better not enthuse greatly on that subject for there can be no certainty of anything whatsoever with H.H. He has been insisting on my staying in Alaska this winter and when I mentioned old friends I wished to see on the islands in the fall. "The office will of course choose the man for the next trip there." He's a tyrant. Woods lost his nerve, I guess. Having given bond & being behind in collections he returned to the boat. And now it is plain abuse and will be that way clear thru. Well, her's hoping that I can get thru the summer & fall with out any trouble for we need the money.

I ought not to write you at a time like this when I'm feeling tough and right sore at the old man, but it makes me so mad to see how he abuses Woods. He's all honey with me, but not genuine. Now Slim girl, if you write me just in time to get your letter out on each boat. Guess you probably rec'd the map and chart I sent. If you miss a boat I don't get any letter for two weeks and I always feel better when I hear from you and know you are all right. Take care of yourself, won't you. It is only 14 weeks more. Much love, R.

#### [1924-06-25 To Slim(43-4)]

June 25 - Just had lunch.

Dear Slim, A fine day, warm and still - and I'm feeling better than at any time since leaving Juneau. How is my gentle Florence? I said in my last out burst it would be the last for a week. I was wrong. This is it, the last for at least for at least a week and I hope it will have to follow you to Valier. My, this is a fine day. What a scookum sku koom skukum (take choice) trip if I could share it with you. Even Shy feels better today. I saw him _smile_ . He let me write the new sales talk and typewritten it without change. I think I will get anything reasonable if I stay with him next year. Did you get any answer from Cosby? Say, the gulls hang around there fish canning places by the thousand. And they are so noisy you can't hear much else. They are graceful birds even if they aren't good for anything else. Then too, I guess they are pretty good scavengers. Well good by 'til later 13 wks 5 1/2 days.

Evening - Prices have advanced again today for the 4^_th_^ time. I must check my price book again. Hunting talks of leaving me on the coast to work. Seaward and other places while he & Woods go on to Fairbanks. If he does, I know my chances are cut short the North western starts back Sunday P.M. It is 460 miles to Fairbanks so I suppose I won't hear from you for another week at least. I hope you and the youngsters are well, that you heard from Brown & are on your way to Valier - when you want to. I am disappointed in being brought up here at such an expense to visit just two towns, the largest only about 2000. Sometimes I think the old man is off. Now it is about time to get this in the mail and get to my train to Anchorage. I don't know where to have you write me. Guess Fairbanks. I'll get it all at once. Love to you, Slim, and to Moie, Peg & Rich. R.

#### [1924-06-22 To Skinny (44-5)]

Anchorage - June 22 - '24 Sunday.

Dear Skinny, Just in from supper and will finish the day by writing a line to you as per custom. I arrived at Anchorage today at 3:45. Whether I go on to Fairbanks this week is a matter quite unsettled until the little party I am going to have tonight. Tomarrow I can give you data to date on this second set-to. I think I'm not going to like the interior of Alaska, any more than I'd like to go back to Valier to stay. This is a town of about 3000. It is kept up by the U.S. Commission and the tourists. You know the government owns the R.R. which so far has not paid for itself. The government also builds roads etc etc in an attempt to give Alaska a chance. I think it is Shy's idea to leave me here abouts for 30 days. If I don't get safely to 1^_st_^ base tonight my coming to Alaska has been a serious mistake.

11 o'clock. Round #1 over. Shy gone to bed. Went off and left me. I think I'm done. What did you hear from the Palmer man?

Monday - 9:40 A.M.

Dear Slim - How's my little girl this morning? I've gone round & round this morning with Huntting. Here he is back now, all excited. I outlined my position as follows - Our present price lists and selling plan in general is not as when we started out and stands in the way of my success. Prices have been double in some lines and while it makes more money for the company it cuts down on sales and I have no chance to make big money. Commissions remain the same. This is unfair & should have been brought out at an earlier date.

Verbal agreements lost me money last year and worked a hardship on my family last winter. I cannot accept an oral contract on guarantee of return of travelling expenses. I do not think you will get any more checks and I'm sorry, Slim. I hope Brown has paid up. But you can see what he has done to us. He refuses to put prices down so we can sell in quantity. And he refuses to let me return to Juneau where I can sell. Every time I make a sale of $100 or $200 the house makes a lump of money while I make the same commission and sales are far between. Anyway I figure it, I can't get home with any money unless I go at something else. He got pretty hot this A.M. when I told him I thought a lot of my youngsters & must have a written guarantee of a reasonable wage for full time work. I do not think he will do anything for he knows I can't make much over expenses. He has admitted it. I have not thot [sic] him honest from the start. But I hope now we can compromise and that I can get back to Juneau & do what I can. We'll write you when I can get anything definite. Much love, Ransom

#### [1924-06-24 To Slim (45-6)]

June 24 - '24

Dear Slim - That is as far as I got last night. One's time belongs pretty much to H.H. when he is around. Last night he was late going to bed. Well, all is well. I have won out. I get boat fare and car fare both ways. H. H. & Woods have left for Fairbanks. Now I can either make money or fail alone. I made 22.40 today and have two sales to book this evening. Monday I laid off 1/2 day to get the car fare promise, then went out and made 14.90 after that. Tues H H wanted me to go with him. We had a fine day together and he took _all_ the earnings. Such a hod I have never associated with before. He has told me all about Litsey & says L. gave him an unfavorable report on me. That's why I got the kind of support they gave me at first.

Tomarrow P.M. I'll probably get the mail from Fairbanks - 1^_st_^ mail since Kethikau. Only 2 letters from you so far. How are you? My, I've written some dark brown letters, but no occasion for more now. You can go to Valier and trust me to make it O.K. I have averaged 27.20 per day for the days worked, but I haven't had any big days. 35.44 was the largest. You see they have it on me. When I make fair money, the house makes 30% in addition to their regular profit. If they make 10% before, they make 30% now - We can sell at these high prices only to those who don't understand wholesale. I intend to remain & get 6 to 700^_00_^ from the islands in the fall. I hope to make a thousand clear on this trip. Nex year I must get at something that won't be so awful depressing and unpleasant. This year I must stick for we need the money. More later. It is 20 min to 12 I've just finished checking reports. Made 2 sales tonight after 7:30, and they made 16.57, bringing the days com. up to 38.81 - ain't too bad. I'm tired, Skinny. And am going to roll in. Much love, Ransom

#### [1924-06-27 To Slim (46-7)]

Anchorage - Fri Eve - June 27 - 24

Dear Slim, Hello, Mrs Tough guy!

I am wondering how you and Marg. and Mary & Richard are this fine day. I've been on the go. Look at these prices and cogitate on the farce, quality & don't quit sort of application it takes to sell in this town. Only the very blind can be roused to the buying point. I forgot to tell you about what H H asked me not to tell you but I can always tell my close mouthed Slim anything Litsey & 4 of the other salesman organized another wholesale co. and would have smashed H H if they hadn't quarreled [sic] and then told on each other. Litsey's plan was to discourage the good men & then offer them stock in the new co. for their services. I'm glad they failed. It wasn't decent to go at it in that way.

#### [1924-06-27 To Slim (47)]

June 27 - I've had a bad day. There was an aeroplane try out tonight, the first that many people here have ever seen - People were out and all exited. So I took my order book in my pocket and strolled out. Made two app. for Sunday & sold an order to the dock Alerk on jawbone, making 3.60 which will buy me 3 good meals. Meals are awful high here, just graft because provisions are not as high as at Juneau & Ketchikau v no wages. Men are getting 3^_00_^ a day & board & are leaving here by the hundreds.

Tomarrow is mail day -The next long spell away from home like this will have to look mighty promising - Lots of love, Ransom

#### [1924-06-29 To Capt Skin (47-8)]

June 29 - Sunday Px

Dear Capt Skin - I got your letter & Margaret's - That's the third, and no more mail for me until Thurs. So you haven't heard from Brown. Maybe we never will. I think we were fortunate to get what we did from Salt Lake. Unless the time drags for you at home so that you think the change would prove something of an outing, I think it best for you to give up the trip to Summer. You know it is hard work and with the children 'twould tire you out and you want to be at your best for the trip to Valier.

By damn, I went out today & even if it was Sunday & made 16.48 and have 2 appts for tonight. Yesterday I had a hard day. I don't care how hard you work if you don't feel right you can't put it over. I'll have to do a lot of church going sometime to make up for the past 10 years.

Say, Skinny, I wish you would buy some Roman Oats (cereal)^[[Roman Oats Cereal](http://www.romanmeal.com/products_cereal.aspx "Roman Oats Website") - Whole grain wheat, whole grain rye, whole grain oats, wheat bran, whole ground flax seeds.] and try it. It tastes good and would be fine for you, don't you think? That is so much better than using the drugs and oil. Very much relieved that you haven't any troubles. I fully expected it. Now make plans for the Valier trip. I am going as short on the little 25^_00_^ per wk that is allowed me as I can, in the hope of being able to send you the money for the trip in case Brown fails us I have 10^_00_^ saved after sending E A. 5^_00_^. Let me know in time and I will send you all I have.

Margaret, your letter was fine. I'm glad you could go to the school program. I suppose you and Mary and Richard are having great times these days. Just wait 'til Daddy gets home and we'll all have a good time building the play house and putting in the sand. Daddy is now over 2000 miles away from you but the time is nearly 1/4 gone when we'll all be together again. Won't that be fine. Save some of that jam for me. Mary, you save some too. Richard, you are a rascal. Do you want me to bring you some gum on a wagon or what?

I hope your good Margaret does not make a mistake. But if he makes good money, that's a lot. My, how happy I could make you if I could make enough each year that you could have things & do things you would like to do. Maybe I'll roll into the round hole or which ever sometime. So long, dear heart, for now nearly time to mark off another day. They'll pass before we know it. I've been gone 24 days, worked 10 1/2 comm. 230.^_00_^

#### [1924-06-29 To Angel Face (48-9)]

Sunday Night - June 29 - 10:30

Dear Angel Face, That word always makes me think of Nell for that's what she used to call me back in the by gones. There was a mighty right friendship and I'm sorry it isn't any more. But the [rough] shod way circumstances under which I urged and finally got control of Slim was too much for Eric. However, all's well that ends well and I'd rather lose a hundred Nells and a thousand Mother E's and a million Georges and as many Valiers than go back and take a chance at getting Slim the longer and more uncertain tho' more decent way. *(Good Heavens! All he ever did was kiss me)* It may seem a little radical to talk that way now that you are mine and all else is of so little consequence. I'm not sorry that I got you the short cut way - the surest way. However I would give a good deal to get back the good will and friendly affection they once had for me. Perhaps the only advance I can ever make in that direction will be thru the endless devotion I shall always give their beloved Florence. Florence, you are so much more to me than just wife. It was often said of me that I was fickle and would never care for any one. I was not just fickle, but proud. I revelled in making certain proud and attractive ones think seriously about me. I wanted them to see in me if possible a whole lot more than there was to me. Often I was unfair and it was wrong. My pride in this as well as in other things has been a great fault and a costly fault. If your good mother and sister knew even in part what a perfect and unchanging harmony we have in our home they would feel worry for you no more except perhaps that you do not have the things and many and the assurance of them that means so much to every girl. I've got a long way to go in that respect.

Monday AM. Well, I must go to work & I don't feel like work. I landed one order last night that bro't my commissions for the sabbath to 27.86. One man broke his appt & went to the 9:30 ball game. They play ball 'til nearly midnight.

*Tony had to leave Anchorage. H H raised prices to more FOB Portland than the people could buy them right there. They ridiculed him, threatened him. Two hoodlums tried to elbow him into an alley one night. Only people near by saved him from a bad beating. Maybe left for dead. He had much to tell me when he got home. I have to skip some of your letters still at Anchorage.*

#### [1924-07-06 To Slim Girl (50)]

July 6 - 24

Dear Slim Girl, This Sunday, one month and one day since you cried. I have 4 appts for today. It rains and is cold. Hundreds came in for the Fourth. There was 3 fights at 2.^_75_^ each. The hotel man often points out a character with "There is Two gun George" Then narrates the story. And some of these characters look the part too, believe me. In the lobby recent bear chases, dog sales, fur robberies, fish stolen etc. Some of these interiorites [sic] are pointed out as having had at one time or times 1/2 million or so. They have sledded hundreds of miles starved and fought, won & lost. Nothing seems to count greatly with them. You would be fascinated. My, how it rains and is cold. Across the street is the jail which looks still colder. 28 law breakers are there worrying thru their sentences of 30 days to 3 yrs most are bootleggers. Across the street one block from the jail are three saloons. The latter have complied, the former poor fellow don't know how. The almighty and loud speaking dollar. My dear madly loved Slim, is every where rolling.

And now, Bob, I want you to plan for your trip. Whenever I have a good day I think of your trip, our house, Margaret W, Miss Hayes, Fennel, Fred Minty, E. A., my Dad M.B. Crane, Our Montana land and a few others. Excuse me now. You may rest now while I go out and sell some prunes & take dinner with Mr & Mrs Walker whose kids look so much like ours that I didn't dare show them the prints you sent until I remembered they have only 2. We have 3. They are excellant [sic] people. He is a miner. You would cry to hear him tell of the abject lonliness [sic] he has experienced in the interior. He is taking his family with him this time. By damn, Slim, I wish I was in an honest business. It hurts me to do people and that is what we are doing. And I'm tired, tired and tired of it. A nice way to write you, isn't it but it could be worse.

See you in October. Love to Skinny.

Ransom

#### [1924-07-07 To Slim (51)]

_July 7 -_ Dear Slim, Well Skinny I thought this would be one day I wouldn't write to you, but you know how it is. A fellow gets in, and its bread day light, sun way high, reports made out. I made 19.40 today. Sold some oil to a garage. H H wired me to stay, tho I'm almost thru.

_Tues. Night_ Jut got in and tired, oh gee gosh so tired. I am going right to bed. A blank day, Sylvia Florence & I bet I walked 30 miles. I got your letter of June 17. Good night, I sure am tired, but I won't be this tired again here, for I won't have the nerve to keep at it in the face of sure defeat.

_Wed Night._ Hello Bob - another blank day. That is nearly. I made 3.56. No word from H H. Rain. Not discouraged but it wouldn't take a lot of urging to put me at another job.

_Thursday_ Train just came in from Fairbanks. In a few minutes, I'll get the mail, if any. No business except a barrel of oil. I will never again peddle cheap remedies & prunes & would quit right now if I didn't think I should stay with it. You've no idea how I hate it in town. These blank days beget more, for it takes all the pep & and success possible to keep up. If I don't hear from HH this week I'll go back to Seward. - Love from me, Ransom

#### [1924-07-14 To Lonesomeness (51)]

_July 14 -_ 10 o'clock taps just sounded.

Dear Mrs Lonesomeness, I'm sorry you are lonesome Slim, but it give me a good feeling to know I am missed so much. We are the pair for this sort of life aren't we. Here I am 2100 miles from the only place I care to be and I guess you don't like these 4 or 5 months apart a bit more than I do. We'll see we don't do the stunt again. I broke my fast east night but only after I had bagged enuf [sic] business to make me feel better. I sold my man too. You thought I couldn't in the awful state of mind I was in. That brings the day to 25.73. I don't care how hard the day when I make 25 or better. I can imagine you & down there all asleep. 12:30 here. Take care of yourself amid those fires & all else. Love to my four Ransom

#### [1924-- To  (52)]

Dear Slim, Margaret, Mary and Richard,

There isn't much to write you tonight, but it isn't 10 yet. I had prospects lined up and tho't I'd have a good day, but not a sale. I'm through here now and have no place to go as H H says wait for him here and we'll go to Seward together. And he says he won't join me for 2 wks. Pretty good! What? If he is that near thru you can expect us in Seattle a whole lot sooner than H H. thinks. They haven't done well in Fairbanks, woods either sick or drinking, I take it. He was drunk many times at Ketch & Juneau. Seems 6 years since I left home but has been only 6 weeks. It's a great life. Well goodnight, Slim and Marg. and Mary and Rich. I think of you just about all the time and wonder how you are. Lots of love - Dad

#### [1924-07-17 To Slim (52-3)]

_July 17_ .

Dear Slim, You little angel face, I just got your letter of July 3 & 4. and am sorry to hear you have been so lonsome and tired of it. Do you get afraid at night? I've been thinking you would. Well, I'm glad you are gone to Sumner if that's the case but take it eacy, won't you? The days go by and each day we are making a little. That's gratifying. If the other fellows work as hard as I will, we'll get to Seattle before September, but they won't. That was some letter I wrote you but it was the truth. This has been tough. I write differently to the boss. You know Skinny, it never pays to write the boss the other kind. He thinks I'm hard boiled, seasoned. And I've got to stay with Parks Bros until something better. It is bread & butter and pretty good butter compared to what we have sometimes had. E.A. seems not to gather courage. I'll send him a little money but I'm close run I hope he can find some light work. So Richard talks right along. My, they'll tire you out down there. I suppose you won't be there long, though. I must get to bed for I'm tired. Write me at Juneau after Aug 1 Seward until then. Goodnight sweet heart. I'm blinkin'. Its midnight and almost dark. Check off another day and keep smiling. Its only 6 or 7 or .... weeks. Love to my Slim, Ransom

#### [1924-07-19 To Slim Girl (53)]

_Matanuska_, Al - July 19, 24

Dear Slim girl, Cause up here last night. Sunday I go to Palmer & hope to finish there, for it costs 15^_00_^ a day for the car and driver. Monday to Wasilla and I don't know how about going farther up. See how it pans out first. Then I'll start back to Seward. I do not think it will take more than 40 days work to cover all - Am pretty sure to be back by Sept 10. However, do not let my coming early interfere with your Valier trip. It will be fine for you to see your mother & Nell again. This day has been a great rest. I was so tired out that I don't know how far I could have gone today even if it had been possible to get the conveyance. Today I sold a lll of sil at Shylock's new prices, but I'm too tred to go out after business. Tomarrow I'll start again if I feel better. Great life this. Fine people here, though, just mighty fine - some old Dawson early timers.

#### [1924-07-21 To Slim Girl (53)]

_Metanuska_ - Monday. July 21

Dear Slim - Got back to Metanuska last night about 10 - no dinner, no supper but sold some goods, about 160 - going to Wasilla today, to Steward Tues, probably. Feeling better all the time since getting out of Anchorage. Great wild country this is. High mts and snow close at hand. More later -

_Tues P.M._ On train enroute Seward. Have been too busy to talk to you. Last night it was 12:30 when we got in and I was out early & sold 170^_00_^ before train time 11:15. But the trip up there was a rest. Now if I could go on to Juneau instead of waiting at Seward, I'd be glad. Will have opposition & a lot of it at Seward, same as at Anchorage Mts - water & mud flats all along here. Ice & snow, glaciers hundreds of feet high. It's cold in passing them. Seward, boat going out now so will ship this along - Love to you - R.

#### [1924-07-27 To Florence (53-6)]

_Seward_ Sunday P.M. 6 o'clock

Dear Florence. The Yukon is in, also the train from the north and the town of Seward teams with life. About 200 from the boat besides a train load makes a difference. Hotels won't hold them so some must sleep on the boats - three boats are in. Fur shops and curio shops are crowded. Wish my wife were among them and we were going about a[s] they do, just having one big time. Will that time ever come? Not unless we get at something that will pay real money. Of course we can though. Others make good money and we must. I am thinking that if I am unable to get at something in the states next year, I may come up here with several different lines and just see the friends made this year. That is if I could persuade you to come along as far as Anchorage and if we could make it look good on paper before land. You probably are wondering why I am writing you today when I already have two letters on The Yukon. It is because I am a great talker and all that, but more because I am feeling so much better tonight. I have taken the whole day off and feel just tip top. Lets go to Lake W. for a swim. I found a Gideon Bible here in my room and have read more Bible than for years past. Last few songs of Solomon, all in fact, made me homesick. Wish I could buy you one of the nice white furs - Fox. I have seen rooms and rooms of furs, and fur farms and furs and various kinds of hides hanging on cabins. At Matanuska a bear came into town while I was there and made quite a bit of excitement. They are monsters up there in the mts 500 - 1500 lbs and some say 20000. However an old sour dough told me there wasn't a 20000 bear in Alaska. Fishermen, cannere railroad men, freighters, guides, trappers, hunters, miners, prospectors and a few ranchers - they all exist in a carefree way. A few merchants, hotel people, gamblers bootleggers etc make money. The tourist is well cared for and is a good source of revenue for these towns. If I had no children to care for but just you - and had lost ambition to ever get anywhere, - I'd like to come to Alaska to stay - hunt, fish, trap, boat and see the most wonderful places they tell about, and rest and rest. This is the ideal place to rest, the easy place to get along. The climate is good, wild fruit and garden truck is plentiful. Everybody gets along somehow.

But of course we've got to do better than that and now is the time to be getting ahead. Soon our three will be needing a lot of things we want them to have. That is whyI've decided never to quit another job without first having reasonable assurance of something better. This is an awful life to live - never home except at a loss, but it is paying for the place we have to call home and it will build on another two rooms and complete the house and get the furniture up and maybe build a three room house to rent. It is better than a year ago, Slim, and we've got to pay these debts and never run any more like them. Great the day when we own the home and owe no one.

I suppose you sometimes get tired of my continued talking aobut money. I know you do. But do you know men always want to discuss their weakest and their strongest points? Ever notice that? I have always been a poor manager. That's why I didn't finish school. I had the ability but not the management and nobody ever saw in me possibilities to warrant helping me through. The Tones are good workers but small earners and poor managers. Any Tone who married a good manager had a chance in spite of himself. None of them ever saved a dollar himself. I have of late years given more thought to the financial future and I am some how going to get ahead. I had hoped this trip would pay off the 1500^_00_^ and leave us free for some gains next year, but of course it won't and I'm disappointed. And I'm soured on this job. The next two months will be _painful_ . I hate the word Parks Bros. But I'm going to stick and stick and if I don't get anything better I'll be selling prunes next year.

A bit 6' 5" fellow here has several gold nuggets, some of them nearly a pound and the hotel clerk tells all the swell young ladies that this man has a great mine and is richest of all gold miners, but has never had time to even have a sweet heart. Then its fun to watch the girls try to get acquainted with him. He plays the part right well - Has done it so long, I suppose. He's cold & polite, leaves a group abruptly and dodges introductions. He isn't worth a thousand, they say, but he provides much fun when the boats come in. Well, I dread tomarrow but there are about 60 more such to dread. My, but I dislike this city work. H H is worried and he should be for business isn't good. I see I am mentioned for may and during that month I got in only about 15 days and those on Whidby [?] and Shaw and Lopez. I only sold 1200.

Well, here I am back at this again. I guess I'd better sign my name and quit, its nearly nine and I'm rolling in early. Got to sell 'em tomarrow and then only 59 days. Goodnight, little lover; like to kiss my little Slim tonight and hold her long after she's asleep. Florence Sylvia, with a life time of errors and failures to account for, still I have succeeded 100% where millions fial, in the most important thing in a man's life, "the taking of a good and stisfactory wife." For you are the truest and dearest and best wife that ever a man possessed. This is the thousandth time I've told you ~~that~~, but the first time I ever called your attention to this great success of my young life.

Voici moi, merci! Et comme je 'au, Skinny^[Thank you for seeing me as I am, Skinny! - Translation by Benjamin Nyman], Ransom

#### [1924-07-24 To Slim (56-7)]

_Seward_ July 24, 24

Dear Slim, Rec'd your letter of July 11^_th_^ - written at where you and Mrs Parkinson's mother went for berries - was forwarded from Anchorage and came in on the same train that bro't me. I arrived tired with a headache that won't quit. But I managed to get a little business yesterday. I suppose you are all tired out and back in our own uncomfortable home. Of course it was a change for you, but must have been hard too. H H didn't come in on the train. I failed on 3 prospects tonight. Haven't made expenses so far. Believe you me I'll go as fast as I can to cover the ground and when I return to Alaska it won't be with the bob tailed line of Parks B.

An old sour dough I worked on tonight gave me a quizical look and scratched his head and said "Well, you don't sell flour nor sugar nor milk nor feed nor butter --- Why do you call yourselves wholesale grocers? You sure's hell ain't, now are you?"

While at Valier find out all you can about New York and try to get some idea of prospects for selling the stock. Also see Crocker and get his idea of a sale. He'll tell you the truth. Must get to bed early. Love to thee, True blue - Ransom

#### [1924-07-25 To Slim (57-8)]

_Friday Night_ . July 25

Dear Slim, Rec'd your letter today, also notice from P.O. at Anchorage of pkg which I suppose is the suit. Thank you. It will add to my burdens but I'm looking pretty tough in the old grey. Nearly 2 years, you know. Well, you must be having a dickens of a time in the berries. I hope you don't go and over do and get all tired out before the Valier trip. I haven't been feeling at my best for awhile and today I started out early to walk into the country and rest and then caught a ride and finally landed at a Road House the Seven Mile. It seems all road houses in Al are so named. I worked on about 9 as well as I remember and failed on all but three. Getting worse all the time. After a while I'll probably be a plum failure at the business. Old Sky is going to stop off & see if he can sell where I left off. The ding old buzzard! No wonder Woods quit him and went to work in the mines. Here I must anchor and do darn well to make expenses while he kills a week up the line.

The time goes by and we are not making much money. Smith, the new Ry Mgr sent out by Secy Work is to arrive tomarrow. A strike has been averted. A joke on me if his coming would settle htings at Anchorage to the extent that Sky could follow up and write all those people who wouldn't buy from me because they didn't know where they might be in a month. How telescopic? And how microscopic too. Gee, I'm a wit sometimes. And the worse my old cupolo feels the more foolish I get. Well you deserve a rest after reading such a mulligan as this. See you tomarrow. Boat going out Sunday. Wish H's wife would wire him to come home on this boat.

Night, Sleepy Slim. You've been asleep these four hours. Dream on, Light of my life, fare well. For crimes unknown I go to my dungeon cell. 6X7 1 - Love R.

#### [1924-07-28 To Tony (58-9)]

_Summer, Wash_ Monday - July 28 - 24

Dear Tony, Evening, and I am "berry tired." Thank goodness this week will be the last. Parkinsons came out yesterday P.M. then I washed and company came in all evening so I didn't get to write to you. Richard was feeling rather bad on his birthday, cutting double teeth so I had to spend some time cuddling him. Davel [sic] came out yesterday and picked nearly a crate today. Mrs Elliott isn't very well and isn't planning to pick any more so the youngsters will have her with them most of the time. She went over to Mrs Gaults this P.M., who gave her all the currants and apples she wanted to pick. I'm going over too tomorrow eve. They make such good jell[y]. Say kid, do you know anything about the value of Reliance land? A lady here (very pleasant, North Western Univ graduate) would like some information. Her father died recently very suddenly and her Mother wants to sell the S. Dak[ota] farm. She lives in Illinois, and knows nothing about its value. It is 1/2; mile N or NE of Reliance 480 A in a piece. Her husband runs Paulhamus deary herd. She would appreciate it a lot if you would write what you know of it, or send the name of anyone you may know around there.

_Tues. Eve_ A long busy day. I made 1^_00_^ & worked hard for it. Mrs Elliott picked currants for me & this eve I made 7 pints of wonderful currant-apple jell[y]. Say, did you know they never wash the berries at all in the canneries? Whew!

I had been feeling blue when your letter said it would be Nov 1, but I'm all hopped up now in anticipation of your return in September, maybe. Gee, Tony, you have no idea how I have missed you. I couldn't ever tell you. No, I didn't get much afraid in Seattle and not at all out here tho' our door is never locked. Can't be. Dark again - at 8 o'clock. Must get the girls in from the sand pile.

Goodnight, honey - Florence

#### [1924-07-30 To Toughy (59)]

_July 30 - 24_ Summer

Dear Toughy, Oh, but we are a dirty outfit. I'll be so glad to get home and get the kids cleaned up once more. They play in this black sand so much that I just can't keep them looking decent. I didn't pick this afternoon but hurried over to Mrs Gault, picked currants and made jell[y] for Mrs Elliott who did most of the work toward making my 7 pints. I'm homsick for our little two room house in "Flat roof Valley, " as Mr Parkinson calls it. Maybe that is why people go berry picking - so they will appreciate their homes when they get back. Well, it won't be much longer. I'll get only 3^_00_^ bonus by staying but that will more than pay the kids their 10%. I will have made 25^_00_^ or better. A lot of it went into jars and sugar, but won't it be nice to open a jar whenever we want to next fall and winter? I'm so glad you are going to be home to enjoy some of our garden - corn, squash, pumpkin and tomatoes anyway. Hurry up Sept 15^_th_^. Only 46 more days.

#### [1924-07-31 To Toughy (59)]

_July 31_ - _Thur. Noon_ - Oh grand and glorious feeling! We are going home Sunday. Vern is coming Sat P.M. to mend the flat tire (the weak front one) and get an early start Sunday before traffic gets bad. A letter from McKune came today. We have 3.83 credit there. He sold chairs 4.00 cot 4^_00_^ stove 5^_00_^ fruit jars .75. We have paid in 60^_00_^ already. It does count up. This won't leave here until after Aug 1, but you might still be at Seward. I sent one yesterday to Juneau. Isn't much of a letter, but will let you know we are all O.K. and loving you the same as always, only more so. Your Skinny

#### [1924-08-02 To Slim (59-60)]

_Seward, Alaska_ Aug 2 - 24

Dear Slim - Thanks for the pen. I can write you better now. It is a little dandy but reminds me of sore fingers and my tired little girl stinting on the little allowance to give me something. I suppose there will be a letter for me on the boat tomarrow but maybe I don't get it until I get to Juneau - about the 14^_th_^. I'll leave for Cordova tomarrow and expect to be there a full week unless I can catch a mid week Pacific SS boat. I've lost practically 10 days here & near here waiting and waiting and now I'm going on. Awful sorry I couldn't go on up to the camps. H H has made 30^_00_^ per day up ther. I haven't averaged 5^_00_^ here at Seward.

Well, never mind. I'll knock 'em dead at Cordova. Two at Juneau, two at Ketchikau & home by Sept 10 maybe. Time do pass by some how. But I hope I can make some money these next few weeks.

Love to my Slim. Ransom

#### [1924-08-03 To Florence (60-1)]

_Aug 3_ - Dear Florence, No, he didn't come but is stopping at Matnuska & Anchorage I'll go on to Cordova & see what I can do there. It's just too bad I can't make enough to bring home a nice fur for you. Wouldn't you like that? But wait 'til next year. That's what I've been telling you for several years. Do you think I'll ever give you a real comfortable home and some of the things you want & should have? Last night I dreamed of an awful fight and blood and aching head and hands & arm too tired to move. Must have got an awful betting. When I woke up my hand was just paralysed. I'd been sleeping on it. You see I'm heavier than you. I can hold you all night but not myself.

Lots of folks waiting for the boat which is reported due yesterday and expected some time in the night Sunday. Many are "going out." This part of Alaska is hard hit, no cork, no hope of work. Even some of the sour doughs are going out but I guess they always come back. Most of the "cheehaukers" have had enough. If I come back next year I will come prepared to make money. Otherwise nto at all.

Well, her I am again - End of room, turn right, up 1 flight, turn right up another, turn rt up again, turn left. Follow the alley down past stables, stalls hen coops and all - turn rt and proceed as before only a little more cautiously. Pass both & toilet. No mark on door to give you an idea where it is or whose it is - but keep on going - count six on the left, scratch a match and you might find a number on your door. This day I've just idled around. Up at 7:30 but wasn't hungry so didn't eat 'til nearly 10. Then I wrote some letters and read some more from the Songs of Solomon and talked to an old sour dough for a long time. Dinner at 4:30 and more idleness. Feeling tip top tonight could easily whip my whole family. Another few weeks, honey, and I'll be with you and so happy then. Seems a year. Write me at Juneau for awhile - say until the 20^_th_^ or until I change my mind. It won't take long to work Juneau. I think I'll be there about 2 weeks.

Now I'm going down stairs and hear some more cold and bear and LaFollett etc. Love to my Margaret and Mary and Richard. Tell them I'll be home before long. And take care of yourself Slim girl. I love you a lot. Ransom

_Aug 4 - 24 Monday_ A.M.

Dad Dear, Safely home again mighty glad to be here. Vern came after us yesterday P.M. Garden has grown a lot. I have spuds, carrots, beans and beets. I picked a dish full of cucumbers to make some pickles too. I'm awfully lazy though. Hardly want to move. Plan to go to Valier next Sat. A.M. if I have enough car fare after buying hats, shoes and socks for the kids and myself - and pay for haircuts and coat cleaned and laundry.

_Evening_ Went down town this P.M and bo't shirts, bloomers new shoes and silk socks. Made an awful hole but I just had to have them. Neighborhood same as usual. Mr Spenser's brother has bo't Goldsberry's lot and built a tiny shack on the back end just across from our chicken house. Some bad forest fires again. They say Crane had men set one to burn off his lot and it has spread all over that end of the woods - burned a lot of Martin's Wood and trees etc. I haven't been up yet. Rosa's house nearly done. They had an all day party & dance yesterday. Much noise and stamping and yelling. Imagine they had plenty to drink all right. I stopped on the street at Sumner a night or two before leaving to see the Washington Engine demonstrated. They aren't mfg yet. The gen'l manager (put in by his father in law, the v. pr) was doin' 'em dirt and he was fired and dad-in-law removed from the board. They are still trying to sell stock at 10^_00_^ a share. _We_ could have more at 5^_00_^ he said. They are getting the marine Eugine patented now. Heard from Marg. today. I misunderstood about the book. _She_ didn't write it. Is much wrapped up in dreams of her Chicago Engineer at present.

Awfully sleepy and tired. Wish I were sleeping on your shoulder tonight. Much love to my T.T.T. Skinny

#### [1924-08-06 To Tony (62-3)]

Wednesday AM Aug 6 -

Dear Tony, I've just been looking over the time table & planning how I'll go to Montana. Can't make very good connections. I will be rushed at Glacier Park to get off, buy another ticket and recheck the trunk. Train stops only 15 minutes - so I have half a notion to get off and spend the day there from 11 A.M. till midnight - then take the train again and get into Conrad at 4:30 A.M. We will be a tired bunch, I 'spose when we get in.

Forest fires here are pretty bad. Had the fire truck out here yesterday. The new houses on the North side of 58^_th_^ almost went also Martin's big wood pile & posts that represent so much work. They are all pretty mad at Crane. It is burning a strip clear thru from 56^_[th]_^ to 58^_th_^ Even Mr Mathias had to back fire. We are safe here because of the wide open space which Hoovers have cleared but I can't help but wish the woods right back of us were burned out a little more. Peggy went to the circus yesterday with Mrs Elliott & David and had a big time. Gee, I'm tired this noon. Packed part of the trunk and made 3 qts of cucumber pickles. Thank goodness I'm not out in the hot sun picking berries. Thought there would be some mail from you but they will probably come tomarrow. A boat came in yesterday and another today from Seward. I hope all is well with thee. I hope they don't try to make me pay for Peggy on the train. I just can't, that will be all.

#### [1924-08-07 To Tony (63-4)]

Thursday - Aug 7 -

Dear Tony - Your long letter full of plans came today. I've thought for a long time that you ought to be at something that either _paid_ us for being separated or we ought to be together at something of our own. We mustn't live apart any more. I'll be glad when you get home and we can plan. I agree with you that we ought to hang on to this half acre. We could rent the house just as it is to Mrs Elliott, I think, if we should plan to leave Seattle. Whatever is best for our financial success is O.K. with me. I can stand Seattle all right if that is best. Anyone with your brains and ambition and willingness to work ought to be making those qualities work for himself instead of the other fellow. No use in making the Shylocks of this world wealthier. Only a little over a month, R. M. T. and we can be together again. Gee, dad, you don't know how glad I'll be. I left Rich with Mrs Elliott and took the kids down town to get new hats and shoes this afternoon. Tomarrow I must go down and get a marcel and my ticket. Mr Pardo will tape us, truck and all down to the station Sat. A.M. Instead of paying storage Mr Parkinson suggests that I run the car down back of his garage. They will see that no kids monkey with it. I'll take the old white tent to put over it and that will help to keep small youngsters such as June and Buddy out of it. Vern had quite a time getting it started down at Sumner. The battery had run down but after considerable craking it finally decided to go and it ran as fine as ever. I'll have finally decided to go and it ran as fine as ever. I'll have Mr Pardo run it over for me tomarrow eve. Fires much better in the woods tho' they need rain to put them completely out. Crane's fire burned way over east and completely out. Cran's fire burned way over east and south of Mathias, over toward the Lavilla Dairy.

I had a gentleman visitor at my house last night Mr Tone! A Mr Jones, friend of Thomases came over and cut the kids hair and trimmed mine. Couldn't do an xtra [sic] good job by lamplight but they look better. Rich especially looks awfully cute. It is nearly 10 and I have a busy day ahead of me tomarrow - and the next and the next. I really ought not to spend that 35^_00_^ but I've written them and promised the kiddos and besides its too darned lonesome here, without my Boss around -

Much love to Toughy, Florence

_Thursday_ 11:30 A.M.

Nice morning, warm sunshine, quiet water. I've been sunning since 9 on the top deck. A few whales and many porpoise have shown themselves. The porpoises follow along in the waves of the boat their backs showing above the water every few seconds. They go in herds and are 5' - 8' long. We are to arrive in Cordova about 4 P.M. today. I'll probably get the Alaska out of there next week for Juneau. H.H. is to come down on that boat. Nothing new to write you. One week of August gone. Soon see you. Not more than four weeks. Love, Ransom

#### [1924-08-09 To Tony (64-5)]

Sat. Aug 9-'24

Dear Tony, First lap of the journey almost over. We will be getting into Spokane soon and thank heaven neither of the conductors said a word about half fare for Peggy. A new man gets on again at Spokane, but I believe we are going to set safely thru. Don't know what I _would_ have done if there had been any question, for I have only two bones (besides car fare) to east for meals tomarrow and next day and hotel at Conrad tomarrow night. I sure wish they could meet me but I think Geo is away now. Well, we are going to get along just fine anyway. An elderly couple just across the aisle know Fautches very well. Mr F. is still farming down at Buffalo and Paul is working in the smelter. The lady remarked "I like Mrs Foutch very very much."

It was right cold and cloudy when we left Seattle, but got pretty well warmed up in the Wenatchee Valley. We went thru a dinky little burg awhile ago and I said to Peggy "What wonderful town is this?" She stuck up her nose and said "I don't see anything wonderful about _this_ place. Nothing is wonderful except our dad and our mamma." We have one ardent admirer all right. I brought every one of Parks 5 lb candy boxes full of sandwiches and two fried chickens that Haovers owed me, eight deviled [sic] eggs and it is _all_ gone, mind you. I never saw such appetites.

_At Spokane_ 9:30 P.M. Mary is stretched out asleep in a double seat with a friendly elderly man. Peggy will have a seat to herself and Rich and I one. I'm awfully tired but the other two refuse to go to sleep.

Shelby Mont 2:00 P.M.

No one to meet us so we have to wait here until 5:30. THen get into Conrad about 7:30 and then a hotel. My cash is holding out pretty well. Nary a word was said about Peggy. I tried here to see if I could find anyone going to Valier, but failed. The cheapest anyone would take us was 15^_00_^ and I came all the way from Seattle for that. I think Geo is supposed to be in Montreal, Tidymans at Banff and I'd just as soon walk as have Mandie come after us. Glacier Station made me homesick for you. So did Cut Bank. Remember that first meeting after we were engaged by letter and that awful drive from Cut Bank home?

The pastures and prairies all along are nice and green and not all dried up as usual in August. If the grass-hoppers have not done too much damage we may be able to have a good sale. I'll talk to Kester and Crocker as you said.

Must return a milk bottle and clean up the infants after their lunch. They have been most awfully good. Not a tear except when Rich had a bump and he is wearing the same pants and all that he left Seattle with. I wish your days of torture were over, sweet heart. I'm glad to be here, but gladder will I be when I'm going back and it will be time for you to be home again. Heaps of love to Toughy, Florence

#### [1924-08-10 To Slim (66)]

Cordove, Alaska Aug 10, 1924

Dear Slim - You'll think it strange that I just chucked a 6 page letter written to you at various times since leaving Seward. It wasn't the kind of letter I should send to the kind of wife I have. What darkly blue letters one can write ~~when~~ if he feels that way and just writes without doing much thinking. And how much better and more reasonable to pass on the best and not the worst. It is a long time since I've heard from you. There should be letters for me at Juneau. I left Seward last Tues and expect to leave Cordova day after tomarrow. Have had very poor success. Last month I mad 310^_00_^ & with the work I did it should have bro't in 600^_00_^. It is nearly 2 months since I last saw HH. Perhaps he is aboard the Alaska. I doubt it though. The Standard Oil people have a plant at Seward and also one at Cordova and with our advanced prices I could not sell a single bbl. The first time I've ever failed an oil. I shall have a great deal to tell you when I get home. You'll probably have to resort to falling asleep in self defence as you used to do when I'd come in from a building and loat trip and nearly talk you deaf. But I won't have any 820^_00_^ monthly report to give - not half so much. Fancy that! But I swear by the beard of Brigham Young that H H Huntting won't do any better than I do when I have an even break. Maybe you have received the commissions from Salt Lake and are already at Valier. I hope so, for I want you to go. By stinting on my weekly 25^_00_^, I've saved enough to meet the N.W. Mutual Life Ins premium and I send you $_ with this. Even if you haven't received the notice better send along the money anyway. I am so disappointed on this trip. But our friends better not know. Sooner or later we'll come out winner. It's got to come and then our friends & relatives interested & concerned and otherwise will take renewed hope and trust in us. If ever a man on earth had the cause and the desire to succeed, I'm that guy - Goodnight, dear. Ransom

#### [1924-08-12 To Florence (67-8)]

On Board the Alaska - Tues. 3:20 P.M.

Dear Florence,

Parks Bros A I Blend deceit put me on here. I got past the watch dogs at the gang plank by marching right up said gang plank, chin and third vest button well in advance and when halted, said I had business with the purser. I then hunted out the purser's office and then I told that fat gentleman that I was wet - drenched - and afraid I would be sick and if he would be so kind as to receive my ticket I'd count it a life saving favor. He said I was not supposed to come aboard until 5 as stated on the board but since I was already there I might stay. I then told the ~~purser~~ white watch dog that the purser had said to come aboard and since that part of my ticket had been taken I went down and got my grips. So here I am, thanks to Parks Bros Wonder Deceiving System; while a great crowd is down there under the shed, some wet, some awful wet and some awful mad. It's a mile uptown and I was so wet I had to change my clothes. I'm disgusted, just more than disgusted. Only a few orders were sold on our way up but it was enough to do the knocking. They claim here that they have lost money on the goods. And they did. I just barely made it here. Feel better all the time, though was in pretty bad shape a few weeks ago. And of course that accounts some for the poor results I've been having. Health is the first and most necessary thing in selling. I have been unstrung ever since the trouble at Anchorage. I'm getting off at Juneau and shall spend one week there, long days, hard work, a fair trial and if prices at which we sold there have knocked the hope out of us, I'm off to Ketchikau. I'll be owing Parks Bros for years to come at this rate. See how the old bird stays in the interior, working the camps. Damn Parks Bros. I am sick of their alloy game - square deal that's as round and flat and thin as a Cival [sic] War dime. My, but I've been bawled out by people who have bought - Damn Them - after awhile. Not yet though. Got to have something better first. Perhaps I'll stick all winter. They say that when a man fails to get results, it's his own fault, and I know there are always a lot of folks willing to be deceived. But just work won't get them. It's how you work, and how you go at ~~them~~ it depends on how you feel. I'm sure I can do better at Juneau. That is, if prices we sold at haven't been told around. Most of these dissatisfied people talk loud & long.

It's a little bet of a swindle, Slim Florence E. I'm not so much account, but I'm no good at any skin game. Can't get all cylinders working. But I must. Do not worry, Mrs Skinny. Leave that to _I_ . We'll make you a good home yet. There will be a few hundred from San Juan and by steady digging thru the winter we'll get along somewhat better than last winter. Better be so. We are just leaving Cordova - dinner just over, grub fair, nice people at our table. My room mate Mr Love, is a hardware salesman from Seattle. Nice fellow, tired of the Alaska territory. Wish I could work as I did at first in April. Maybe Huntting will provide a good territory & not ask me to work North of Seattle. We'll keep on the look out for a better job and work like - at the one we have.

I wonder if you are at Valier now. I hope so. I want you to have so many things that you don't have when you say you are content I wonder how you can be. Such a perfect little lover and pal you are and how I'd like to kiss your sweet face a hundred times right now. Is there anything I wouldn't do to make you happy if I just had the ability to command big money? You are worthy so much more than I've given you. You still have some hopes yet though, don't you? For you haven't admitted to yourself yet what a poor bargain you made by mail.

#### [1924-08-13 To Slim (68-70)]

Aug 13 - '24 Going across the Gulf.

Dear Slim,

Not so rough as we expected, and warmer tho' still no sunshine. They say it will rain up here from now on until snow comes. I'm feeling tip top this morning. How's my wife? Won't I be glad to get home! From the boat schedules I judge it will be about the 22^_nd_^ before I can get out of Juneau. And if I find business is good it will be a week later. Then Ketchikau for about 2 weeks. Won't do to hurry at this stage. Boat fare will be free both ways if I stick right thru and if H H holds up on his promise. He will too.

Last night I talked with Mr Love until nearly 12 and didn't get up 'til nearly 8. In his sojourns it seems Love has travelled over pretty much the same country I have lived in. He is very bright and not a bad sort. Says this is positively his last trip. Going to quit the road. I hope I can accomplish something these last four weeks. I think that on arriving at Seattle I'll call on several or all of the wholesale grocery and supply companys [sic] and try for some sort of job that will be steady and not mean such long trips. I do not think the Parks job will average 250^_00_^ a month counting last time and all, and with no more than that there isn't much gained by having a road job.

Health and a good front, Mrs Skinny they spell success. I've even quit coffee and every form of food that's a hold back. While in Anchorage I talked with a man and his wife who had agreed to eat nothing and do nothing that would ~~be unfair to~~ impair health. He quit all forms of liquor, coffee, tea, tobacco. And neither of them will eat hot cakes, or pie, or dumplings or meat more than once a day. They take certain exercises advised for bowel regulation and they sleep a full 8 hours. They claim they will live for 90 years. They showed me pictures taken 5 years ago and the change is remarkable. Do you think you could live that way? Suppose I managed somehow to get a job that would be pleasant to do and not keep me all unnerved as this game does and then try to build up to the best possible health. Let's try it. Could you quit coffee & cigarettes and would you try the exercises? I'll get the job that will keep me home and then I'll help you try. I know I can quit the hooch if I really try. It would be great to have tip top health again. It's the 1^_st_^ key to success with a man. And besides, you and I would be great pals by the time we were 90. It would be worth a million dollars to each of the youngsters too, for they would learn it & be better for it.

P.M. In line with the dope of this letter, I skipped lunch. No exercise, no eats. The water is rough now but the Alaska is long and rides well. Nearly every one keeps to their state rooms. I'm anxious to be at Juneau and have it over with for I hate it so. I've rewritten my lingo cutting it down some. If 30 calls a day will make one 3 sales we'll make some money. There will be mail for me at Juneau - Hope you are happy and well. More later. I must write to HH.

Thursday 11:30 A.M. Guess we'll reach Juneau before 4 today. I'm looking pretty tough. Must get out the blue suit and have it pressed. Haven't worn it yet and I was so wet all the time at Cordova. Nothing to write you. I'm going to Juneau against grain but determined to make it count. Hope you are O.K. today & that I'll hear from you. Love - Ransom

#### [1924-08-13 To Tony (70-1)]

_Valier_, Montana Wed A.M. _Aug 13_

Dear Tony, Just before I forget about it. Mother says that Geo heard some men talking who said that _all_ state land has been turned over to that 33 year payment plan. Perhaps they are so busy with it all that that is why we don't hear from Helena. They have prospects of a pretty good crop here if early frosts don't get it. Everything is late. Lots and lots of empty houses in the whole country. I went fishing yesterday A.M. with Dr Tidyman and Leonard and he said there was only one family living on the road between Valier and Dupuyer. The pastures are good so our stock ought to be in much better shape. I can easily see though, that there has been no chance for a sale and that things still are in bad shape financially. No one has any money. Dr Tidyman says Jim is making more money working for the company than he is.

We fished out on Sheep Creek about 25 miles out, at Wilburs if you know where that is. I hate that brush fishing. One can't get up to the creek or cast at all. Just have to hide behind the willows and brush and drop  your line in. I caught two. Spent most of my time chasing grasshoppers for bait and dreaming of you. Tidyman caught 25, mostly small ones.

They got 250^_00_^ out of Bill's wheat to apply on the debt to Kester. Mother said she had him make out a credit slip and sent it to us. Do you remember anything about it? I don't. Bill never answered anything about the other 300^_00_^ but there is a good chance of getting it too. That would help out considerably on our debt to old Kester, wouldn't it. Mother's finances are in worse shape than ever. She fears they will lose the Aberdeen land to those who hold the mortgage. There is such a big ditch tax that many people up there have just let their land go. Gee kid, there is nothing to this land business. We want just a little business of our own - an oil station or a confectionary or something that I can run if necessary. I wish we _could_ go to Alaska & just rest & rest up there in the mountains. I'd like to rest too, but there won't be much rest for me for ten years yet. Then the kids won't be such a care. Now that I have had a taste of real air and of the kind of warmth that warms ones bones without tiring or burning, Seattle seems more obnoxious than ever. I think I feel better already.

Mother is going down town so I'll let her take this along. Hurry home to us. Always your Skinny

#### [1924-08-13 To Toughy (71-2)]

_Aug 13 - Evening_ Dear Toughy. I've written you once today but I'm so lonesome for you. It's just as bad hear as in Seattle, for Valier and surroundings are so full of you and memories of you and our early days together and everything. Tonight Tidymans took us over to the big flume near Monson where Everett is working. The big posts are rotting off under the ground and concrete bases are being put in.

Remember several times we drove around "the Trunk" together and our honeymoon out on the Deyo place in the clean sweet smelling wheat field? You know, Valier has sort of a sad sweetness or sweet sadness for me - if you get me. Sentimental associations, I suppose you would call it, but it makes me think so much of the thrills of the first kisses and the first times alone. The sight of a bunk house or irrigation ditch makes me thinking of you. I was _crazy_ about you, Mr Tone, from the beginning unto this very evening.

I talked to your friend Mrs Woods who used to sing. She said "Oh yes, I know your husband very very well. He has such a beautiful voice. Is he doing anything with his voice?" etc. She thinks it a shame you don't sing any more, as do Mrs Tidyman and her mother Mrs Maxwell who is here. Mrs T says to "tell him if he ever comes back here, he'll _have_ to sing!" It is too bad any strained feelings had to come up, for the Tidymans really are good sports. Nell says Everett and Jim have been going pretty much to the dogs - drink and girls, Jim especially. He and Marguerite St. Denis are engaged now.

#### [1924-08-17 To Tony (72-3)]

Valier - Thurs P.M. Aug 17 - 24

Dear Tony, We have just come home from a Ladies Aid surprise party, a fare well to Mrs Elmer Smith who is going to Conrad. All the old Methodist standbys were there - Mrs Pond, Tidyman, Leech, Hughes etc etc. Probably you wouldn't be interested. Mrs Pond said Bert Ufkes is here on a short visit from Illinois and was asking just today about you. I had a long talk with Mrs Ed Harrington (Ruby Noreen - Mrs Wilkinson's sister) Mr Harrington died of T.B. a couple of years ago in Oregon and she is back here now working for the water co. She is nice. I like her. Everyone tries to tell me I look so well and so much better than when we left and I tell them that raising wheat in Montana would make anyone look old and discouraged. I never could describe all the feelings I have toward Valier. When I feel myself getting a friendly spirit toward anyone, I look at them and wonder if _they_ said abominable things about my husband and Lu and if they talked about you and I immediately want to freeze 'em up. Lou by the way, will arrive here in a week or so from Wyoming with her 2 months old baby boy. Bee and Maude called this P.M. same as ever, Bee with her big little girl voice and Maude of the loud laugh. Mrs Fox is quite sick, been in bed for a week and they don't know exactly what the matter is, a combination of rheumatism and a bad heart. I had to go to Emery's hardware store on an errand today and Bill Emery wanted to know how you were etc. The other day old Starbuck lifted Mary & Richard up on the counter and made a big fuss about them and actually pried loose from two 5¢ all day suckers! Starbucks have _six_ children, the latest a pair of twins.

Had quite a bad hailstorm this P.M. Ruined the gardens here in town. I was afraid the windows here would be broken. There was a terrific wind along with it.

I ate 3 big pieces of cake and 2 cups of strong coffee, but it is 1:30 A.M. and I'd better be trying for some sleep. Toughy Guy, I'm lonesome for you this night. Fly down here and Richard and I will make room for you and we'll talk 'til dawn. You must be almost at Cordova now if you got away the 10^_th_^. One more day gone, beloved. Take good care of yourself, Tony. I love you always - Your Skinny

#### [1924-08-16 To Toughy Guy (73-4)]

Aug 16 - Sat P.M. - Valier

Dear Toughy Guy,

Toughy Junior is sick today. Has a bad earache and cold and I have to hold him most of the time. Haven't been the same myself since eating those tree pieces of cake. Was quite sick all day yesterday but feel better today. Nell & Mother were invited to some mother & daughter party this afternoon. Glad I'm here to take care of the kids. They have all been angelic so far.

_Sunday P.M._

We all feel better today and Richard is his old playful romping self again. I can't help but always worry when his ears bother him. Mother brought your two letters when she came home last night. Thanks for the post cards. The Alameda almost made me weep. Maybe it will be bringing you home soon. I plan to leave here the 1^_st_^ of September so that Peggy can get started in school and I can clean our little house for your homecoming. Too bad Sky couldn't have taken you instead of Woods and shared some of that 30^_00_^ a day with you. Pig! Pretty swell to top the whale list, I'll say. I'd like to see you with Ridgeway this winter - or with something of our own started so you could be at home.

Went to church today. The minister is about to leave for Conference. He isn't very well liked. An M.E. Minister has a hard row to hoe all right. Saw your old red-faced, red haired, lantern jawed friend Henry Pond. We dropped in to see Ma Fox on our way home. She is laid up in bed with rheumatism and looked so white and thin. Mother stayed all night with her last night, as Maudie and Ernie went to the Park for over Sunday. Maude is still awfully fat - must weigh 175 - Bee is thinner. It seems that poor Lill was married against her mother's wish. The old lady refused to stay and see her married after Lou's wedding but went right off to Conrad and California, and has never seen her since. Made many tongues in Valier wag.

Am considering crating the oil stove and oven from the ranch and shipping it to Seattle. We can't get anything for it here and it wouldn't cost much - about 2.50 - to send it from Conrad. Will try it out first and see if it still works all right and heats up quickly. That little old one we camped with was N. G. Nothing more to write except the same old things that you know so well. Your Skinny

#### [1924-08-16 To Slim (74-6)]

_Juneau_ Aug 16 - Sunday Night

Dear Slim, Really too tired to write you tonight, but I got two nice letters from you today, one from Seattle & one from Shelby (2 P.M. the 9^_th_^ ) and I must say goodnight to you. That is great mail service. I understand an independent co. has put on a fast boat. Glad you got along so well but I know you must be tired out. Try to get a rest if its possible with 3 youngsters. I hope you found the folks all well and that you'll have a real good trip. I must send you more money, sent you 20^_00_^ last mail - to Valier. If only I could keep going as I would like to, I'd do lots of things for you, dear. But it seems I reach the limit every day I work. Nothing to fret about though, for I'm feeling 33 1/3 go better than when at Anchorage. May 34%. Today I made 30.96, yesterday 28.48. I have always done fairly well when I had the pep. Tomarrow a rest and Monday another good day. Tuesday likewise and Wed. Falls off again. This is no job for me. I should be running a fish boat or a laundry or a chicken ranch or working for M. B. Crane.

How's my old friend Harvey W. Is Reader there abouts? Valier! That word makes my knee ache. Try to see the Norsbys. My regards to all friends and love to the folds. Goodnight. Did you get the little Esquimo slippers I sent in the roll of clothing~~?~~ from Seward? They are made from hair seals. I've seen the seals. And I've seen some enormous whales and hundreds of porpoises 5'-8'. I've seen salmon and cod and herring so thick in the water that they made one think of maggots. How do you spell Maggets, Mrs Dictionary? I think it is magots. That's the shortest and best way, anyway. Got to quit. Got a headache. No, the knee ain't too bad. "Count your blessings, " I'm glad I've still got that foot - a little obstinate and unfair to the other, but a pretty fair propeller at that.

_Sunday_ - This has been a long lonesome day, and tiresome. I didn't go to church because I didn't want to shave because my face needs a rest because it gets shaved every day because it needs it because I have an awful beard.

I suppose the youngsters will have a great time together. Do the folks plan on staying at Valier? See if there is any news on the new contract we have on the home quarter. Get a look at the cattle and ask how many there are and what it is casting to keep them. We don't want them held over at great expense. Write the Register of State Lands at Helena. I think the equity we have, if we still have any, will be taken by Power - Wilson after the sale. That's all I ever did in Montana, just lose with the one exception. I love the old state and all that's in it because of you. Hope you can go to Glacier and fish in our pool and see all of our nice things up there. Make your visit just as long as you wish and let me know your needs. I will see that you get whatever is necessary to make it a good trip. I don't want you to skimp or come away owing anybody. I hesitate to tell you how poor I've done after all the boasting I did before leaving Seattle. But anyway I'm making enough so I don't want you to pinch. Do you know I've worked only 71 days since April 1^_st_^. There was so much time last in May and this waiting for boats up here is the bunk. My commissions amount to about 1300^_00_^. You & I have between us drawn about 875^00^, leaving us near 500^_00_^ saved in addition to paying for car, home, storage etc. That 18^_00_^ a day ain't bad considering the poor stick of a salesman I am. It's not as good as we tho't, but with that and 4 or 5 more weeks here and 6 wks in the San Juans. We ought to finish the house this winter.

Better not show my letters to anyone because I always ramble on when writing to you. Tell me how you are enjoying your visit. Soon you'll be coming back & I hope you'll find me at home when you arrive. It is hard to say when I'll be thru in Alaska. I am not waiting for Huntting or depending on him for anything. I've bought a return ticket with stop overs with company money, and I always keep 50 or 75 on hand in case I need it. And I'm doing just as I said I would, whenever I get tired, I quit. As soon as results fall off, I'll just quit. No more "Anchorage fashion" for me. Believe me, I came mighty near sickness up there and at Matanuska a whole week's rest when I get home. This has been a pretty hard trip and the long days - why, they played baseball at 11 o'clock. At Fairbanks they always play a midnight game on the Fourth of July. They sleep walking. Juneau is something less than 3000 and is, I think, the prettiest place in Alaska. There are far better and larger homes here than in Valier or Elk Point. Fewer dogs and better people, I've noticed. 5 or 6 churches, M. E included. Fishing, mining, farming the tourists & gambling are the leading industries. The M. E. pastor at Seward is an early Dakota Wesleyan [University] sprout - knows folks I knew there. Guess the Catholics makes the biggest noise up here.

_Night_ - Well, if there isn't still some space to write in. How's my little wife? And our three? And your mother & Nell & Geo & their 3? Like to see you all tonight. Margaret, your dad has a beastly beastly head ache. What do you think he'd better do? Go to bed? All right I'll go right to bed. Hello, quite contrary, and how's Fat the boy the neighbors call Richard? And hello to Margaret M.

Heaps of love to you, dear one, and to all the folks. RMT

_Valier, Montana_ Aug 18, '24

Dear Toughy, Not much to write this day. This A.M. mother & I, accompanied by 7 kids walked down to the lake. Took a couple of pictures, mother watched the birds as usual and the kiddos picked up pretty stones and lugged them home. Saw our good old friend Mrs Starbuck this P.M. down town. They have only _six_ children now, 3 in the last 13 months. Latest is a pair of twins. Likewise talked to Mr Hofland who promised to come down tomarrow and pay at least half of the 15^_00_^. Then I'll send the life insurance pmt. Saw Mr Kester on the street, tho' he didn't know me. He is much more gray and looked seedy in an old grey suit. The old cream colored car he used to drive four years ago was parked out in front of the bank. Valier has been hard hit, all right. I can tell it by the way the ladies dress. You don't see the silk dresses and spiffy clothes like you used to. Talked to Dell Gaff too and saw her three weeks old baby. Dell is very thin, face lined and looks a good deal older. Producing and bringing up a family is enough to make anybody old, but maybe that's our main job in this life. I know you are not overly interested in all these Valier facts, but there's nothing else to write.

We sent to Sears Roebuck today for Jap crepe x23 per yd for the same stuff Valier Merc. charges .35, Want to get Peggy a couple of dresses for school. Mrs Thomas took the machine away, so won't have a very good chance to sew when I get home again. The Valier merc by the way, has gone into the receiver's hands. Fay has lost all his money and is trying to sell his home for less than half of what it cost to build. They say he lost ----- on accounts with people who couldn't or wouldn't pay up. Dear old Lady Law is still in the country, on the Gurner place, but Jim has left her again. This is the 18^_th_^. Less than a month I hope, old kid. Won't we be happy, though! And never again.

I love you, Mr Teeny Tiny Tony - Always your Slim

_Juneau_ Monday Night. Aug 18, 24

Rain, rain all this day and they say it would not be uncommon if it rained steadily until snow flies. I mean rain, not Seattle mist. I stayed in as long as I tho't I could afford to and then went out some as I would in Seattle. In a short time I was wet thru and I've been chilly & uncomfortable ever since altho [sic] I changed suits. This will not do for rheumatic cripples. No more Juneau for me, Huntting or no Huntting. I'm on the Yukon next Thursday if she isn't loaded above the dorsal fin. I'm going to Ketchikan. It rains there just as bad but I have friends there I must see. About 1 week there and I'm off for Seattle, arriving Sept, or there about. So you won't be there to meet the boat. Do not cut your visit short but stay as long as planned. I'll rest up for a few days and get out to Bellingham and Friday Harbor. This change of program isn't going to please HH and it wasn't made to please him. It is I who have the bum knee and the cramps. Whatever he may say or do won't make any difference with the schedule of the Yukon and I'm going to be on the boat. And if it rains like this at Ketchikan I won't stay there more than the one week between boats. It is sure to be raining there for the wet season has just begun. They say it rains almost continuously there all winter; here it is too cold. My radiator is singing, and windows are all closed but I am cold. Last night I slept in heavy woolen underware [sic], heavy socks and night shirt and was cold. I'm going to migrate. Good night, Slumber Slim - Ransom

#### [1924-08-19 To Skinny (79)]

<span class="fauxUnderline">Tues. 19^_th_^ </span> - Well Skinny, it rains and rains and is cold. And it is only thru luck that I got reservations on the Yukon and can get out of here. It is reported that over 200 were left behind at Cordova who wanted to get aboard the Watson and there are as many here waiting to get out. The hotel people told me there are as many here waiting to get out. The hotel people told me there wasn't a chance for me but there is always a last chance. This morning I put on my best suit, best tie, best pin etc and after getting the name of the Alaska SS Co's office man entered the office with the confidence of David. I said "Good Morning, Mr Nowell." He said "Good morning, how are you this morning." I said "Wet" and then I lied a little, but that's nothing. I've been telling big ones all summer. I told him I was three weeks behind time and the office was impatient and it was important I get to Ketchikan this week, that the company would appreciate it very much if he could put me on the Yukon. He didn't say what company or how much do you ship over our line but just took my name and said "Drop in Thurs and we'll give you your reservations." Huntting is to arrive on the Yukon and I suppose there will be some friction when we pass. But whatever may happen I must not stay. I hope he will be reasonable. Love R.

Valier - Aug 21, 1924

Dear Tony, We have just come home from calls on Kester and Crocker and while it is all fresh in my mind I'll tell you about it. Gee kid, I wish we could raise a couple hundred. Our note to Crocker was 450^_00_^ in the spring of '21. I figured up the interest at 10% compounded and we now owe him 600^_00_^. He says if he could be paid 300^_00_^ he would give the note back and call it square. He says "Frankly, Mrs Tone, I would insist on a sale this fall after some wheat is sold. Your horses will never be in any better shape and they are just getting older. Mr Kester has so many horses and cattle like yours that he doesn't know much about them. You see horses with the Bank Brand every where, on the Heights, on the reservation, over by the mountains." He was awfully nice. When I told him you said Alaska would be an ideal place for a man who had lost all ambition and just wanted to rest, he said that would certainly be the place for him, that he had lost most of _his_ ambition. He will try to sell the binder before harvest to someone who wants a new one.

Well, old Kester didn't give such a lot of information. He was friendly enough, but you know how he is. He doesn't favor a sale. He has turned the horses out on the range now. It cost so much for pasture. The range would be good, I expect, until late this fall, but I do think we ought to have the sale then and get what is gettable, if there is such a word. Kester said it is nearly impossible now to see Bullock who is running for district judge. He isn't home at all, but K. will try to bring the other 300^_00_^ case against Bill to trial. He thinks we will get the money. That would sure help out a good deal, wouldn't it. Somebody skipped a car load of horses out and they didn't bring enough to pay the freight. Mains shipped 4 carloads and lost 1000^_00_^ Kester says they really need good young horses as much here as anywhere. It was a glad day when we left Montana, sweet heart. Would that we had gone when we were first married, but as you say, experience has taught us a lot. I put an ad in the paper to sell the stoves and what other furniture we had and Squaw. They say if we could get 20^00^ or 25^00^ out of here to grab it quick. Do you suppose we will ever get anything more from Salt Lake? Would it do any good for you to send him a registered letter, or to ask Mr Griffin to go and talk to him?

_Friday P.M_ Just about ready to go down after the mail. Haven't done much of anything today. Sew a little, read a little, talk a little and the day is gone. I'm beginning to feel excited over your homecoming. Not so very many more days. I hope not more than three weeks. Gee, kid, hurry. I wish it were the middle of September right now. 'Spose you are on the boat today enroute to Ketchikan. Wish I were with you.

Richard is sitting here on my lap. You will notice a big difference in him. He talks so much more, romps so much more and gets better looking every day. Mother says he will never be as fine looking as his father and I agree fully. He wants to take the pen and "wite daddee." Lots of love, Florence

#### [1924-08-18 To Skinny (81)]

_Juneau_ - Monday AM. Aug 18

Dear Skinny, Just got an armful of mail - great bunches of it tied up. I've wondered why I didn't hear more from you but thought you were probably busy. It will take a long time to read it all. A notice of a cable gram came but I notice it was received at Seward on the 5^_th_^ of August and I've heard from you with letters written since then so it is either S.D. or New Mex or Iowa, I suppose. No use worrying ^>^Twill probably be bad enough when it gets here. Has to be relayed via Ketchikan, Seattle, name & will require tow days, they said. HH is to arrive at Juneau this week. That means 2 or 3 weeks more here and less at Ketchukan. So write me at Ketch & stay as long as you like. Raining hard. Hope it quits for I must make all of my 25^_00_^ yet today.

Valier - Aug 19 - 24 Tues Eve

Dear Tony, Gee what a strenuous day this has been. Thank your lucky stars you aren't a woman washing & ironing for 6 kids under 6. I'm afraid our three extra are almost too much for Nell. They make so much noise and the M's don't get along very well & then Nell has to scold heres and shut her in the bathroom! Great doings. Edward & Mary get along just fine. Richard hangs around me most of the time. He is getting to be an armful momma boy but 'spose I won't be in it when Dad gets home. Well, I'll never be jealous if the kids think more of you than of me because I know how they feel, being in the same the same [sic] boat. It really would be more comfortable for me if I didn't like you so much. You shouldn't be so nice, kid. Then I wouldn't miss you so.

Tidymans are away so Nell invited her mother over to dinner tonight. Had swell chicken pie and I'm stuffed. Tomarrow we are _all_ invited over to Maude Goffs. Won't it be grand with all those kids.

_Aug 20_ . Wednesday Eve.

Home again after a pleasant afternoon and a regular Goff dinner - every thing imaginable to eat. No wonder Maude is fat. The children all behaved very well. I was awfully proud of the behavior of our three. Poor little Richard came to me out in the kitchen and kept saying "Oh my, I sick, Oh my, I sick" and up came the three roasted marshmallows he had eaten. Then he wnet to sleep and had no supper which was a good thing. The four girls ate at a little table by themselves without an upset. Maude has an awfully nice, unaffected, modest little girl about eight years old. Mr Wesmantel, the bakery man drapped dead this afternoon. I saw him yesterday looking the same as ever. What an awful shock that must be for his wife. I want us to live to be ninety years old. I'll follow the rules and take the exercises and quit the cigarettes and most anything if you'll only stay home and help me.

R. M. Tone, what business have you chucking _my_ property. You just mail all my letters, please blue or no blue. I want them all from you. Dad dear, I do love you so. You can't tell me old H H is a better salesman than you. I know you too well for that. You can outsell 'em all. You didn't send anything for the Insurance premium but I won't need it. It is only 10^_00_^ and Hofland will surely bring me money soon. If not I'll send it out of the weekly checks. Am going to put an ad in the paper tomarrow and try to sell the range, the heater and anything else I can. At this time of year, lots of people move in to send their kids to school and maybe I can sell them. Have quite a lot of room in the trunk and thought I'd bring home a few tools from the ranch, saw, pliers, screw driver, level etc. They won't bring anything at a sale anyway and you hate so to borrow from Seattle neighbors.

This letter from Mrs Fautch came today. I'd like to see her, but couldn't think of going way down to the Falls with these three kids. Besides it will soon be time to start home again. About Sept 1, I think. It won't matter if Peggy is a day or two late. Mother is ready to come to bed so I must get Richard and his pail of buttons and into his own bed. Good night, beloved.

###### Skinny

I know something _you_ will have to give up, Toughy, if we are going to live to be 90- all of your pet _worries_ will have to go. You'll have to get your flat feet fixed and what about your knee? Well, we can do our darnedest anyway. You would be flattered for me if you could hear everyone talking about how much younger I look than when we left here. Mrs Gilboe stopped me on the street asking if I wasn't Mrs Tone, and talked a few minutes or so. They all want to know about you and I tell 'em all you are just fine and enjoying your work in Alaska etc.

#### [1924-08-22 To Toughy-guy (83-4)]

Valier - Aug 22

Dear Toughy-guy. Awfully lonesome for you tonight, sweetheart. It seems as if I could never let you go again, not even to the San Juans, when you get home again. I keep thinking what if something should happen and I'd never see you again. But probably that's because I'm tired and dreadfully lonesome for you this minute.

Aunt Clara wrote to Mother asking her advice as to paying out on our land. I gathered from her letter that she was fairly ready to do so but Mother advised her strongly against it. So there goes any chance of saving our land, I guess, unless we can possibly raise 87.50 ourselves by the 12^_th_^ of Dec. Mother says she doesn't want the land or the papers or any responsibility or anything to do with our 160 A. Says she will lose some of hers this fall, probably. George lost every acre of his, even the buildings into which he had put about 3500^_00_^. Gee, kid this Valier country! This trip has helped me to be increasingly thankful for one great blessing, that we aren't still trying to farm here. It is beautiful to look at but impossible to make a living on. I saw several of our North neighbors at the Valier merc today. Mrs Swanson with 2 new kids since we left Mrs Low, they move soon to Washington on the Columbia River, Mrs Gamble used to be - Is married to old man South - if you know him at all. I don't. Whiteman's with 2 new additions since we saw them, live a few miles out of Chehalis. Poor Mrs Whiteman, tied to that lazy creature. When I see what other women have to live with! Weren't we lucky that we found each other when the world is so wide and we could so easily have missed each other. But you waited for me, didn't you though ardently pursued by many fair maidens. I saw your might have been son today, Mr Tone, not very handsome to be sure, but if _you_ had been his dad he might have looked better. Har har, Teeny Tiny Tony. _She_ is quite thin, thinner than I've ever seen her. Looks quite well, though. Nine thirty and I must hie me to bed. Am figuring strong on Sept 10. Only 20 more days, three weeks honey.

All love to you, Mr On and Only Man, Your Skinny

#### [1924-08-26 To Toughy (84-5)]

_Aug 26 -_ '24

Dearest Toughy,

Richard says "Me write daddy" and he is scribbling away. Goodness only knows what he is trying to write. Ora younger, the renter on Mother's farm took us over there yesterday afternoon to see the wheat. The hoppers got nearly all of it, and he put out nearly a tone of poison too. It just made me sick all over to see our machinery that cost us so much hard earned money. There is simply nothing left. The tools were all stolen so I can't bring any home. They didn't even leave any pans in the house - _everything_ _gone_ . Squaw and her biggest colt, Papoose or whatever his name was were over there by the gate. Had been there three days without a drink but he phoned to Kester and K. said he would send a rider out after them. They were both fat and looked dandy. Squaw whinnied to me and let me get within a few feet of her. Sandy is nice - has a big broad chest and is quite a bit taller than squaw. Mother thinks he would weigh about 1200 - We stopped in to see Norsby's. Mr Norsby cried when he fount out you weren't here. The first words he said to me were "Is Tone here?" He has aged a good deal. Martin is in Tacoma learning the barber trade and Anton is working on a highway near here. I saw Mrs Todd and Mrs Vest in town this morning, looking same as ever. They said Zellers are living at Long view.

I opened this letter (passenger list) of yours that came to 5558- 59^_th_^ and was forwarded. Tho't it was only an ad. Must get to work. There is always something to do with six in the family. Big ironing on hand just now and sewing to do too.

Don't work too hard, honey boy. Better take the day off when you get this letter. Safe to say, you've been working too hard, and what if you should get sick away off there alone. So rest awhile and think of your old Flossie. It's awfully lonesome even here. Heaps of love, Florence

*And these are our last letters to each other written that summer. And so you came home to us, just about sick from all you had been thru - Old Whiskers arrived in Seattle mad as a hornet - Then invited us down town to a big steak dinner - which must have broken his heart, the old miser. He offered Dad the sales manager job etc etc. Dad had had enough and then some. Just a wonder he excaped a bad beating or worse in Anchorage, or pneumonia or collapse from exhaustion. You never did know when to stop driving yourself.*

*My, how happy we all were to see you when we got off the train - I don't know who was happiest, the kids or I. They all loved their daddy so much. I brought back George's success selling insurance for Banker's Life of Des Moines. We sold our little house, made a down payment on another car, got 100^_00_^ for the little old Ford and away you went a'selling. What a mistake _that_ turned out to be - As soon as you stirred up interest and good prospects, the territory was given to old favored salesmen and you were sent on to be a "bird dog" elsewhere. They gave you Bellingham where no Banker's man had been able to get a foot in a door. Then when Phyl was a few days old, with no warning whatsoever the old Jew Cohen sent a letter saying "sorry, no advance from now on -*
