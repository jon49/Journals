% The Slough Our Great Play Ground
% Ransom Marion Tone

The play places of our boyhood days, if not the brightest spots in the past, are the most enduring memories of our lives. Perhaps only our final departure from this life ever obliterates such memories from our minds. Who does not remember with indescribable pleasure the old swing beneath the wide reaching box elder where there was security from hot summer suns and always a cool breeze. There were stations and comfortable seats and even a jail house made of rough boards up in that tree. It was unlawful but expected of all jail birds to break out of that jail and, eluding armed and efficient officers and chained blood hounds, find temporary haven in the tall sunflowers and heavy hemp patches and thick willow and plum thickets of the slough. Then the posse, including all available citizens, was out to get their man. So intense and of such long duration were these man hunts that it was not uncommon to take along food and bottles of water. The culprit had his food store and water, too. Often it was late in the day and only after covering miles of woods, weeds, thickets, and farm fields that the desperate one or ones could be found, overpowered and brought back. The use to which the offender's own dog could be put on such hunts afforded great satisfaction to us all, especially to the proud owner of the dog.

Hat Kerr did not like dogs. There were too many dogs in town. Everybody knew that. There was talk of putting a tax on dogs. But of course no one thought or admitted his own dog was a nuisance. Hat Kerr, who lived near us and who never did any kind of work so far as I ever knew but was suspected of much petty thievery, solved the dog problem at least temporarily for our end of town. He caught every friendly and unsuspecting dog he could and put them in his shed where he shot them one after another. Then he took them in his wagon down to old Brubecker's corn field and left them there on the ground. We disliked and feared him more than ever after that, fearing for the safety of Old Bruno and other good dogs of the neighborhood. We put rosin strings on both ends of his house which we operated from high crotches of trees on dark nights. The rosin string racket, if persistently carried on, is punishment enough for anybody.

It was about this time that I first met Nell Hasson, the girl who caught toads in her woodshed and burned them alive in the kitchen range. I did not believe this report but when she admitted it airily to me and said it gave her a great thrill to see them writhe and die I had to accept it as a fact. In spite of my otherwise high regard for her there arose between us an ever mounting ill-feeling so undefinable that I never quite understood her or liked her. Some years later I was sure Nell would have been very happy to have had the chance to treat me as she treated the toads when she was a little girl.

A very dangerous sport in which we came to indulge as we grew a little older was that of shooting at one another with shotguns as we wandered about the great slough or along the river. The sudden sound of a 12 gauge and the rattle of shot on dry corn stocks about one sent him crawling to low ground and then a battle was on. Incredible as it may seem we were often warmed plenty and would pick shot out of our clothing on arriving home. Once I got two shot in the cheek that stuck there until George McGrath removed them. They hurt and I fell to thinking what if, by mistake, there were slugs instead of shot in the shells?

Frank Steckmand, George McGrath, Bob Kent, Zeke (Albert Nichols) were some with whom I battled many a time.

Old Mr. Woods, who built a small frame house on a high spot in the slough and went there with his three little girls to live, tried to stop the reckless boys from playing battle with their shotguns but they paid little attention to him. Once, I nearly shot my brother Esla with Mr. Wood's shotgun. I didn't suppose he kept it loaded in the house, as was his custom. I have never seen anyone turn whiter or become more frightened than Mr. Woods. He said he would never keep a loaded gun in the house again and I promised him I would never point a gun at anyone again.

It was about his time that the Leadora was found. But Mr. Henner, who found her, could not get below her deck where the aged whiskey was supposed to be. (See clipping from Union Co Leader and Union Co Courier). She was completely covered with sand and water quickly took the place of any sand taken out of her.

Fin Goss fought a negro from Omaha. Got a blow over the heart, nearly died and had to quit for good. His mother said, "Warren could whip the negro."

Prize fights were being held on the Id.^[This looks like Id in the original. Could it possibly be Ia for 'Iowa' or Qt for 'quiet' instead?], S.D. having banned prize fighting. Fin Goss was training under Patsy Magner from Yankton. Clewie Benson, my cousin by marriage of my Uncle Chas, was also taking training with Magner and could and did whip anybody daring to fight him. That is where I got my start fighting. I loved it and learned to take punishment as something unpleasant and often painful but quite incoitable. Clewie visited us a good deal and with his coaching and backing and with so many of the boys and men for me, I could not do less than my very best. Sometimes, especially when strangers were brought in, it took more than my best and a great deal of endurance to take it. There were times when all my friends and backers had to say was something about my being promising and, of a certain, game and able to take a lot of punishment. At one time I resolved to be the greatest kid fighter in that section of the country. But that was before my folks found out about my fighting.

Once a real horse thief locked up in the Co. jail managed or was helped to escape and, securing a rifle, made his way out of town and hid in the cemetery. I saw him as he came down the middle of the street, the sheriff not a block behind and calling to him to stop. Every time the officer got too close to suit him the escaping man lowered the rifle and the sheriff would stop. I stood not 20 ft from him as he passed me. He was nervous and his hands trembled and he ran and walked with difficulty. Near the school house grounds he met a farmer on horseback and took away his horse, ordering the farmer to dismount. But he trembled so, he could not mount the old grey horse and had to give it up. Mean time, the sheriff had come closer and when the rifle went again to the poor jailbird's shoulder I was sure he would fire in spite of himself, he was trembling so.

But he did not shoot and the sheriff slid behind a tree at the Gilmore lots and allowed the man to turn eastward and gain the cemetery just out of town. Barricaded here behind Grandpa Gore's high tomb stone he settled down to await darkness. Men closed in upon him from all sides. We followed the men paying no attention to their threats and cursings. Now they were within a few rods of him. So were we.

Voices called to the man to "come out with his hands up and save his life," but he was either too afraid or too determined to obey. There was to be a rush upon him and soon, too, for darkness was setting in. But his was not done. Anxiously, breathlessly we waited hugging the ground behind a low, bric lot-wall.

Then a voice came out of the stillness with words exactly, I think, as the poor fellow wanted to hear. The voice told him that an unarmed man was coming to him, a friend who would see him safely out of this mess. The speaker said simply that he was coming, and came. No shot was fired. The thief was put back in jail, tried and sent to Sioux Falls for two years. It was not the sheriff who so bravely captured the man but an old man who lived alone below the cemetery. He had never seen the prisoner before and was unknown to nearly everyone in the posse. I don't remember his name but I do remember that, after the prisoner had been disarmed and hand cuffed to Deputy Hettinger, the sheriff had a great deal to say and said it in a loud brave voice. Some of us were of the opinion that had the runaway man got into our jungle in the slough he'd have made it.

And so were lived our boyhood gang days fighting our best men and our best dogs against all comers. We had our own baseball team - and from it, let me tell you, the town team was largely made up. We knew what went on, too, whether in the church quarrels or the saloon brawls. We knew who were the worst citizens of all and also those on whom our best respect and kindliness should well be directed. Almost or before it cooled, we got every bit of morbid gossip the town afforded. And we knew every poor family and widow that **Grandpa Hines** visited with his large basket half concealed under his long scarf. We laughed at "Dutchy", Cris Grosse, who so often let it be known he had "dedicated his life to his cause and would always be a socialist." but we disliked all who ridiculed and abused him. Perhaps it was because he had the face to stand up to them. Or maybe it was just because he was so desperately in earnest. Anyway he must have done a lot of reading. In later years he loaded me with books and articles to read. He told me again and again that Christ was hated and feared and persecuted and killed because his beliefs and teachings were contrary to the best interests of those who were mean and unfair and powerful. He often helped me with my German and we corresponded in the German language for years. He never ceased trying to convert me to Socialism. Just before his death in 1932 he wrote me pointing out the "progress of the cause" since our arguments began.

I nearly forgot to tell of the time our boat capsized and six of us came mighty close to drowning. It was after the big flood and water still stood at least ten feet deep over the big slough. Only a few of the highest sand points and the Compton, Dafoe and Wallace hills showed above the water. The six of us rowed the Fiskey double-oared boat a mile out. Zip Coverdale, then a very small boy, could not swim. But in the wind storm that came upon us there was little chance for any of us after the heavy boat capsized and went down. Luckily there were clumps of large willow trees not fifty yards away and to these trees we made our way, all trying to help Zip puffing and coughing and fighting the waves which seemed many feet high. We were cold and shivering when Perry Carter, Roy and others seeing us from the bridge a half mile away rescued us from the trees in the big stolen boat we had used so long that it belonged to us. A month later we recovered the sunken boat. I can not explain why we took such chances and were so often in gravest danger nor why a (pitying) protesting providence so often provided us a safe means of escape.

Aunt Frank's meals were so sketchy and irregular as to make her cooking and kitchen work in general quite simple and light. But she was fond of me, and so I often went to visit her and my uncle and cousins at Yankton. Their home was not like ours. I had my ideas about their home and was sure then that I knew why they lived as they did and were, each and every one of them, so unhappy and so disloyal and quarrelsome with each other. A very sensitive and hyper-emotional boy I was, a soul unhardened, untempered by illusage. A boy on whose face the world had as yet left not a single impression. I seemed to feel my way about rather than think on the things I did or contemplated doing. In this home I received more attention and kindness than anyone else - and from every member of the household.

I thought their loose home ties and utter lack of respect for each other were the direct results of their failure to be religious. But in this I was wrong - as I found out later. The trouble was that Aunt Francis did not care for Uncle Char. who was her second husband, nor for their home and little for their children. She was only showing her unhappiness and contempt for it all. She had been doing this for ten years. Many years later, after saddening and ruining Uncle Chas. life, she left him and was twice more unhappily married before she died. The greatest loss to any home or child is the loss of its mother, but the greatest menace to their happiness and welfare is an unhappy, selfish, ungodly mother.

It is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for an habitual talker to cease his talking. When Mrs. Henke had talked about enough her big, silent husband sometimes would slap her a few times and silence her chatter. But her timid resentment had of late gradually advanced a step. Of late when we, along with others, would listen to their quarrels we had observed that Mrs. Henke could strike back and was at times nearly a match for old John. The town relished these quarrels. They broke the monotony. But folks stood aghast when the fights became bloody and some feared for the stout little lady's life when, as he would tell it to the justice after his arrest, he was obliged to strike her hard in self defense. For she would use the stove poker on him. Blood that had run down his cheek into his beard was sure proof that he had been attacked. It was not uncommon to see Mrs. Henke after one of these brawls exhibiting her bloody face and dress and perhaps a badly blackened eye to her friends along the road that was taking her up town to find the town marshall and have old John arrested. How the Henke's managed to live on together in this organized confusion and periodic warfare was a mystery to everyone, but they did. And furthermore, they raised three upstanding and successful boys and a daughter who married well. Old John was mean, dishonest and quarrelsome. As mean and quarrelsome as his two big black dogs that went wherever he went, traveling side by side underneath his high spring wagon.

From the Sullivan's floorless, one room cottage (they were very poor folks) which stood close to the Henke residence I watched and listened more than once along with Billie Sullivan to the Henkes as they entertained the neighborhood with their quarreling and fighting and got themselves into jail.

Eddie Sullivan was Billy's younger brother. He was a quiet boy whose half-hearted laughter came in one syllable or chuckle. Bill used to bring Eddie along with him when he came across town to spend a half day with us. Eddie got the smallpox, died and was buried for over a month before any of us knew about it. The Sullivans had not been quarantined. There was no funeral. The doctors thought best to fumigate and forget about it. I do not think a half dozen people knew about Eddie's death at the time. Eddies leaving us in this way was as hard for me to bear as though I had been closely related to him. This left his half smiling childish image indelibly stamped in my memory. If I could I'd paint that half smile and the trusting, worshipful eyes of a big boy's younger brother.

Meanwhile the old Missouri was cutting away each year at the banks and farm after farm had been washed in and carried away to be deposited again at some lower sand bar or carried off to the Mississippi. Many roads now shortened by a mile or more ended abruptly at the river's edge, a condition known and understood by the natives of course, but a very dangerous thing for those who did not know.

Once two young lads enroute from Yankton to Sioux City to attend the fair got off the main road and it being a dark night, drove into the rivers' fifty feet of swift muddy water never to be seen again until months later when one body was found in a sand bar twenty miles downstream. The other lad and the car were never seen again.

The roar of the enormous under cut chunks of earth as they fell into the water below could be heard for miles. Large, ever widening and deepening cracks along the river told of more and more cutting to come. Standing safely back we would wait for the falling of the big chunks. The currents were coming back across from the Nebraska side. If possible, something would have to be done about it. The Id.^[Unknown abbr.] with its thick forest of willows was fast disappearing. Even the town was threatened. Some folks did not bury their dead there any more. Whole farms had gone into the river which was now within a mile of town.

We played until we were too old for play in the Weston hay barn, swinging on high bag swings. Mr. Weston was fond of boys and there was no objection to our playing on the hay. Of course all this was before we had grown up to the matured age of ten or eleven years. There were expeditions, too, into the slough and river woods, swimming trips to both rivers, fishing trips, and trips that were just trips with nothing especially in mind.

On such all day trips there might be any number of us from four to a dozen, each carrying a sandwich or two in his pocket. Perhaps we would visit the sand pits where the wind had blown out great high bowls, or the ever cutting away cemetery, explosive rock hill. Or maybe we would go to the Sioux R. across which we would swim in order to fish in Horse Shoe Lake or the Dead River beyond.

More than half of the old cemetery had slid down from the hill and been blown away by hard win's from across this River. The ends of aged brown casket boxes were ever appearing. Some one always took care of these, for in a day or two they would be gone. Once we opened one and then ran away in shame and fear for the terrible act we had done. I was glad I could say I had no part in it. It was the grave of Burt Dafoe's little brother the one whose eye, Perry Caster said, was put out by the snap of a cattle whip.

How well a boy sees and knows the minutest things about him. When we are young we live so much better with the other forms of life about us. Of course anyone can, by efforts of attention, even pass into the soil and be one with the digging insects and worms trying always to take an equal footing with these beings. But a boy comes mighty near to actually doing this. Perhaps a boy's happiness depends more than anything else upon friendly interest in every living, growing, changing thing about him. I suppose it is because his highest wisdom is enchantment. With him any disenchantment is a malady to be cured as quickly as possible.

As already related, we moved from town to the farm in the spring of 1898. We had commuted daily the fall before, Esla and I, to do the fall plowing. Rising early we would be in the field by seven and it was late for chores when we arrived home for we did not leave the field until six. Often we were cold and too tired for words when we reached home. 

We heard frightened neighbors shouting and crying in the night. We waded in the dark to help the Larson family. Mr. Larson fell into the ditch and shouted.^[Written in the margin.]

That spring the Missouri left her banks some miles above us and a good part of the arm, along with hundreds of farms to the west of us, was under water for a week. It came to our front gate on the farm, setting us all aquiver and then subsided. As soon as the seeding and planting were finished Esla left again to work out and Roy, though still only a lad, was very seldom home. He had not been home for more than a few days at a time since he was ten, and did not attend school after the fourth grade.

One thing that fretted and galled us all was our parent's unwillingness for us to fish, hunt or swim on Sundays, also their refusal to let us have Saturday afternoons off for refraining from doing those sinful things on the Sabbath. Once we struck after a talk among ourselves and demanded Sat. p.m.s. 

I was chosen as spokesman and father whose ulcers were very bad then told me off. Father was pretty angry and a little reckless in his answer. That was why Esla and Roy quit the farm. They never returned after that except as company, which had been their promise to each other. We had just shelled corn the day before and I remember how fast I worked at carrying the cobs to the shed. Anything to get hold of myself. The boys were going. I wanted to get back into school. With them gone my chances were not so good. I hadn't the courage to risk going with them in the hope of getting to school that way, nor the desire to work for some Norwegian or Frenchman fifteen hours daily for twenty dollars a month. Besides, they could not get along at home without us.^[Written in the margin.]

Father went back on the RR and we moved to town, building a new house of some proportions on lots for which father had traded Maud and Fred and the big brown mare.

We attended quite a few neighborhood dances while on the farm. We were rather hard up and it was a good thing we could attend these parties in any kind of clothes we cared to wear. In my overalls (sometimes I wore two pair) I enjoyed myself more, immensely more, than ever at any other parties before or after those years spent on the farm. There was no liquor and nothing boisterous or ungracious ever went on. The girls, though lady like to an extreme, were kind and knew just how to look after and make a good time for young guys like myself who were too bashful for their own best interests. I shall never forget those dances and box socials nor Elsie Kline and her sister May, and Maud Waldon and her three brothers; Manford who never quite smiled, Jess the 'cutup' and Elwood who played the fiddle. Old Chiever Kline sat in the corner enjoying the music and the dancing more than anyone else and he and Mrs. Kline were on speaking terms again. Tall, black-haired Ira Haybone played the violin better but all liked Ellwood better so he did most of the playing. There were only a few waltzes for only a few knew how to waltz. "Booze" Busenbark did most of the calling and his drawled, half sung orders were filled with funny rhymes and wit of his own making. If any strangers were present Booze never failed to bet with them that he could do something so hard to do that they wouldn't even try to do it. Then, with all taking it in, he would remove his glass eye and put it back again. He acquired pieces of pie and cake in this way and ate them with great relish. Offering this one and that one a bite but never giving it.

We attended the Old Settlers' Picnic that year at Jefferson. Esla and I, driving Old Mat and riding in Mother's fine, green cushioned Stanhope (buggy). It was ten miles, and much further the way we returned home.

So far from home we could do about as we pleased, and did. There was much drinking and considerable fighting going on. Led into the saloon by a bunch from south of E.P., where Esla used to work, I was treated to beer and cigars. The cigars were all right though cheap, but I couldn't drink the beer. I guess this was my first taste of beer.

Our home tailor got into a fight at an egg throwing stand, he and also the men at both ends of the ropes at the stand, being drunk. The marshall was too drunk to establish order and the mayor was sent for. He was a big fat frenchman and began making a speech which soon told all that he, too, was well liquored up.

So about a dozen french farmers and local men took our tailor to the jail and locked him up.

But this only brought on the organization of a mob, of which I found myself a part, for the purpose of rescuing the tailor from the jail. Lou Carey seemed to be our leader. He was potvaliant (pretty drunk), too, and very brave in his threats and statements. The jail was to be stormed and about fifty men were eager to do it. The marshall, now a little more awake, would have released the prisoner but his keys had been taken away from him in order to lock up the man. He was indignant and called upon the mayor for the return of his keys. The Mayor with much assistance climbed into a wagon and from this high position attempted another speech, telling the people that he was the mayor, duly elected, and that they as visitors to the city of Jefferson would be protected and receive his most respectful courtesies. The mayor nearly fell of the wagon. Then in big round smiles he ordered the prisoner released. And the mayor, the marshall, the prisoner and the mob went back to the saloon, filling the dirty place to overflowing.

Late that night we started for home, via the Pleasant Grove School, for Clyde Bland and Vern Rozell, who lived down there, were with us. We had lost Zeke Nichols from our gang late in the afternoon. Zeke was pretty drunk when last seen and we were worried about him.

On the way Clyde sang many songs, mostly sad ones. Some he sang two or three times, being urged to do so. His voice was good and his young, handsome face shown in the moonlight as he sang. It must have been good for I am asking that you believe that, although never having heard those songs before nor since I still have lines and lines of them rushing to my mind at this moment: "In a village churchyard near sleeps the one I love so dear. On the hills of my old N.H. home." And "There's just one girl, only just one girl. There are others I know, but they're not my Pearl. Sun or rain she is just the same. I'll be happy forever with just one girl."

The bottle, which was Vern's, was passed around regularly. It always stopped with Esla for he wanted to keep it from Vern as much as possible. Vern was very drunk and Clyde would not sing unless Vern would listen and refrain from joining in. Even Esla sang a little, something very unusual and unexpected from him. It was natural that both he and I should feel like singing, though, for neither of us passed up a turn at the bottle. When we left the two boys at the corners Clyde went home with Vern. Esla explained that Clyde was planning to leave home. He was jealous, and rightly, of Loren his brother who was his mother's favorite, and too hot tempered to get along any longer with his severe father. I felt sorry for boys like Clyde and Roy who did not get along with their fathers, and especially sorry for Clyde whose mother showed such unpardonable partiality in her family as was the talk in their neighborhood. That was the last time I ever saw Clyde.

It was four in the morning when we arrived home. The liquor had worn off and we were tired. A bed and quiet was all I could think of, but Father met us in the kitchen. His face was drawn and hottest anger shown from his cold gray blue eyes. I thought he was going to punish us and knew he would be sorry if he did or if he attempted to. In a low husky voice he ordered us to change our clothes and get on with the chores. This we did, relieved that he had not detected liquor on us. After breakfast he sent us to plow corn, the job we had deserted for the picnic. Late in the afternoon I fell asleep between the corn rows while plugging the shovels of the old walking cultivator. Startled, I awoke to see Esla pulling along side. He had quit his land and pulled on to mine to warn me that Dad was coming. Quickly he knocked the wood from two of the shovels and we were working hard putting in new ones when Father came upon us. Father was in a rage knowing well enough that I had been asleep a long time. But we were busy now and that seemed to be good enough. That night as we went to bed in the hay loft, the pigeons having been pushed back along the collar beams above our bed with a longstick , Esla urged me again to leave with him and work with Baugh Bros. on their railroad grading contract. We'd make money there. But I did not join in the adventure and did all I could to get Esla to stay or to take some other job. Railroad construction crews were pretty tough gangs. Dad should go back to the RR where he could be as bossy and mean as the job allowed.

Our country was undoubtedly in one of the lanes followed semi-annually by the wild ducks and white geese and brant^[Wild geese.] of various kinds in their seasonal migrations. So there was great hunting along the lakes and both rivers but, alas, we had no Sundays for such purposes and there was work to do on week days. Father was firm and our guns stood rusting - which suited him all right. He had no use for a gun or a fiddle and could recall many young men who had come to poor endings for having devoted their time to fiddling or toting guns. As I grew older I did not blame him so much for I learned more of his early living and I knew he was a man of ambitions, ambitions he hadn't a Chinaman's chance of carrying out. Although he was a good boss he was too outspoken to get along well with people. And in addition he was a man of singular poor judgement, buying, selling, and trusting carelessly, and having no general, well organized plans.

This, however, was not in keeping with his other characteristics for he kept everything in its place and he was as regular in his habits and living as the old clock which he wound each Sunday morning immediately after prayers.

Smiling Hannah Callahan had died along with her first child at its coming and unhappy John, her husband, left the farm. Her baby 6 weeks past due. Dr. Rhoden lost first her baby then her. Mother stayed with her constantly during the ten days and held her as she died. He bought our home on the S.W. corner of town and moved there and we moved to his country home for the winter it being so much warmer than the one we have gotten along in for two years. We were to leave the farm and were now building in town a fine seven room house with a big mortgage on it. Father was trying to get each of the boys to agree, as I had, to pay regularly each month on the new home. To this the boys finally agreed in a half-hearted way and the work progressed rapidly, each one helping at odd times between other outside jobs.

**Grandfather Tone** had come to live with us. He as a sick man and had very few words to say. A liver abcess brought death to him soon (at 70). Uncle Chas. and Aunt Frank were there and all in the household were summoned to grandfather's bedside very early one morning before daylight to see him die and hear his last words. Just why such things are done is still a mystery to me. He said, when asked about it, that he wanted his bones to lie near Nancy back in Wisconsin. "Yes, that's where I want my bones to lie." Then he waved away the cool water swab that was used to moisten his tongue and lips and after directing his gaze upon father for some time looked away and was gone. His eyes rolled up, his legs stretched and quivered. A very unhappy old man had been released from a very unhappy world.

A funeral was held in the E.P. Methodist church preceded by a very long procession of buggies and carriages from the farm to town. The church was crowded with people who came either through respect for my parents or just through curiosity, as is so often the case. None who came had known grandfather. He was unsaved and more than that, had not wanted to be saved. The sermon was flat and filled with very carefully stated warnings, censure and denouncements. Aunt Frank, who had been decidedly unkind to grandpa, did considerable wailing and heavy grieving under her dark veil. Black crepe was worn by all and we were requested and expected to wear the wide crepe bows on our hats for two weeks, but did not.

Father and mother took the body back to Wautoma, Wisconsin. The casket box was covered with metal and was hermetically sealed and soldered. Grandfather was buried beside Nancy Coleman, his first wife, who died when father was twelve. I was sure it was none too soon to suit grandfather. Father was very deeply saddened and hurt by grandfather's suffering and sorrow but his few tears, I felt sure, were mostly for the old man's unhappy life and unsuccessful living. It always seemed to me that father was to grandfather the one and only worthwhile person.

So the disowned of the wealthy **James Monahan Tone** family, the "black sheep", Alf^[John Alfred Tone], was back again on the old family grounds after some fifty turbulent years apart from and unrecognized by his people. Perhaps they had been unfair to him as Father thought, but certainly afterwards he himself made more injuries than were offered to him. No doubt that was what prompted Father to say on that dark, cold morning; "He is better off."

# Spring of 1900

Perhaps moving the family back to town was one of father's greatest mistakes. It meant more years of railroading for him - and Esla, Roy and I were soon working on the R.R., too. Roy at 14 years worked on a steam shovel in the Hawarden RR gravel pit. Esla, 17, joined a bridge crew and I at 16 began digging ditches for water pipe. Father had to sign a release so we could hold these jobs as we were pretty young, seventeen, sixteen and fourteen.

But before I got on the RR crew, I had some other experiences. My first job was to help Bill Goss plaster the house and "Plaster Jim" Smith to build the chimneys. This mason work had not been done when we moved in suddenly to make room for John Callahans' new renter at the farm. Next I took a contract to lath the new printing office which was being built by Mr. Bruce for the weekly "Courier". Then I got a job on a farm working for a Mr. Aloin Brown who lived about nine miles west of Akron. Brown was a small soul with a wide opinion of himself and a very narrow appreciation of others, including his newly wedded wife. She was much smarter than he and I was glad of that for I knew it was going to be plenty tough for her. I quit at the end of the first month, having earned by overtime twice the $20.00 received. Brown was nearly twice my age and much older than his wife, but he was smaller than either of us. He was a mean, brutal sort of person. At first the mean looks he gave me made me feel a timid, hesitant resentfulness and this gradually advanced into a deep hatred. We had some words. Just what was the immediate cause, if there was one at all, I do not know. I wanted to punch him and I think I would have on the night I left if he hadn't been so silent and hadn't withdrawn from the room as soon as we settled up. His wife was silent too but bade me a very friendly good bye after he had passed the window enroute to the shop. Enroute to town I was hailed by a neighbor and stayed there that night and for the next two weeks while the man went to the western part of the state to look at land.

After a few small jobs Father got me a place in Hank Nearman's crew on the RR and this job I held until midwinter when all the crew were laid off.

I had been out of school for nearly two years, but I still had a desire to go back and finish H.S. I hadn't finished the 8th grade and it was tough going back but I did, this time for a full half year. Then I had to go to work again. There was no other way, but I still hoped to finish H.S. some time. I was 15, hard and tough, and weighed 152. I got me a house to house selling job knowing all the time that I was too timid and green for that work. It didn't last, or rather I didn't, and soon I was back on the RR again. This time I got $2.00 per day (an advance of .25 cents) and by living cheaply could save about 75 cents daily. We were on the go all over the division and I learned a good deal about second rate hotels and restaurants. The work was menial and the men I worked with, though friendly and kind, were not my kind-or at least I wanted to be different. I longed to get out of it and resolved to get thru school some how and try to get myself into a different world. This would be hard to do and only a good education would bring it about. I subscribed for a beginner's correspondence course in law and of evenings applied myself diligently to the lessons, reading and rereading the books and knowing little more about them than before reading them. Some of the men encouraged me and were very friendly, others had ways of showing their pity and unwillingness to believe I would ever get anywhere with the course. I guess I didn't look very promising and I knew even then that I was a slow learner. All I got I had to dig for. The law course was abandoned when I entered school again the following year.

No one but myself could ever know how I looked forward to getting back into school and on thru with it. It wasn't the school I liked, it was the idea of getting thru with it and on into something better. I was not an indolent boy but I thought I had seen enough of hard drudgery for small wages, - in an environment wherein I would not be happy. Once I had only thought of getting thru the 8th grade, now I was determined to finish H.S. and had some faint thoughts of college and perhaps special training. These thoughts made me very happy and warm inside. I wanted to discuss them with others and did whenever there was a chance for it. Anticipation is the realest thing a man ever knows. And like the horizon our aims and ideals recede as we advance towards them. There were in store for me for the next two years steady work at the store each vacation, Saturday and right after school, a room alone at home and at the end a H.S. graduation diploma. They let me attempt three years courses in two and allowed me to skip the eleventh grade. The small number of graduates coming up in the 12th grade and my advanced years had something to do with this unusual privilege given me for I was slow in school never ranking highest in any of my classes.

We are rich or poor according to the proportion between our desires and our enjoyments. Even when I was very young I seemed to sense in myself champaign desires with only beer abilities of obtaining what I must have in order to live fully. At no time did I accept myself and my environment as I suppose I normally should have. Instead I began early to look way ahead to the time when I'd have property, wealth, much education and accomplishments to my credit which would give me the standing and distinction enough to more than make up for the very mediocre station and unsatisfactory rank to which my slough existence then held me.

This dissatisfaction with my lot was encouraged greatly by the coming to our home and town a lot of our dried out western Dakota relatives who had been and were still underprivileged in no small way. I feel certain that their coming was largely responsible for an unfair and unhealthy attitude I gradually assumed towards people and towards living in general. It has taken me many years to find out the error of such hopeless resolutions as I made then. What seemed then the biggest and surest star to which to hitch my cart I see now as the greatest mistake of my life. It is true that some of the unusual and determined resolutions so deeply embedded in my mind have not been entirely without value or reward to me, but undoubtedly most folks do not continue in their aspirations year after year in willful opposition to nature. The really smart folks try to get a little pleasure as they go along life's highway. And, la-la, if the making of our lives depends wholly upon the functioning of our glands what's the use? I think if I had it to do over I'd concentrate on the study of the glands. 'Twould not only be easier but more fun then for a very commonplace fellow to determine irrevocably to make a bigger frog of himself than his natural limitations could possibly allow.

I have known people who believed firmly that no man can be shaken from the purpose that is written along side his name when he comes into the world. Others have seemed too well convinced of the overpowering laws of heredity. Both theories and the matter of environmental change and effect are too controversial to be accepted by a person like myself. Certainly one can be no more nor any less than those who have gone before. Background capacity, glands, environment, - oh, shucks! lets drop the matter here. I believe, or hope, it will be possible for me to keep from being as mean as some of my ancestors are said to have been. Neither do I want to be as good or as successful as some of them know they are.

I think I have stated elsewhere in these pages that whatever else may be the matter with me I am not fatuous enough to think anyone is interested in my life story. But the account of the daily and yearly life of a sub-moderate South Dakota home in the 90's and early 1900, the environmental influences, the predestined happenings, sage brush changes - all these could be of interest.

As I lie here in bed and write of the days so far back, my mind is flooded with details which crowd in wanting to be recounted. Perhaps I am the only person who could possibly be interested in them, now that Esla and Roy are gone. Then we were all together - that is up till 1893. I was then nine. We raised corn and beans down in the sloughland which was owned by nobody, for nobody would pay the back taxes. In 1895 we rented land, in addition, from Joe Smith north-east of town. We also still drove the herd to town as we had been doing for three or four years. Then we moved to the Dan Flannery farm in spring of 1898 after doing the fall plowing in 1897. I was 13.

After the cholera had taken about a hundred of our hogs and harvest rains had ruined the grain and the boys had left, we moved back to town. Spring of 1900: Father seemed happier to get back to a steady salary and mother was busy with her church work and well content in the new home. We built a 7 room home (1900-1901).

My first store job was at the Teli Anderson Grocery. This I quit to work for Henkin & Henkin where I worked for several years on Saturdays and vacations and nights after school.

1904    1904 - Was graduated from H.S.. Sold Chantaugua Industrial Art desks through Nebr. to Beatrice. Then went at store work in Lincoln and Havelock. Came back to RR steady winter's job. Resubscribed for correspondence course in law and worked hard at it.

1905-06 Entered Dakota Wesleyan University 2 months late in fall term. Represented the college at the International Student Volunteer Convention at Nashville Tenn. in following March.

1906 - Summer at Henkins store. In fall filed on homestead in Stanley Co. 18 mi. north west of Philip on Deadman Creek. There was no Philip then not even a RR through. (Rapid City was a small cow town.)

1907 - In Oct. I proved up on the land. Was offered $2400.00 for my 1/4 sec. Kept it 14 years and after paying taxes on it sold it for $1950.00. Worked at Ringsrud Merc. Co. E.P. in clothing department

1908 - until summer. Then held rural school house meetings for the National Prohibition Party. Had my speeches and songs learned verbatim and the office advance-agented for me. I liked this kind of work but was pretty timid at first.

1908 - 09 Taught school Vivian, S.D. Lived at Minty's

1909 Summer school at D. W. University

1909 - 10 Attended D. W. Uni. again. Summer night school at Philip. Fisler Inst. Business training, Bookkeeping. Dr. Ince's office. Had decided on Med. Course. D. W. School.

He forgot to mention the ulcers that tortured him.^[Written in the margin by Florence Tone]

1913 - To Valier, Mont.

1913 - 14 Taught school Belgium District, Conrad

1914 - 15 Uni. N.D. Pre Med.

1915 - 16 Taught school Valier, Mont. Prin Jr. High.

1916 - Farmed. Bought 1/4 sec No. of Valier. Roy spent a year with me.

1917 - Married at Great Fall. Aug. 11. Partnership with E. Mattke and Jno. Pierce. Farmed their land, also mine and Deyo place. (Dried out).

1918 - Margaret was born in July on the ranch north of Valier. (Dried out). In August (written above: July) I hurt my knee. (Dried out).

1919 - Had the knee operated. (Dried out).

1920 - Moved to Frances Heights Ranch. 480 A wheat that year and 810 A flax. (Very poor crops hailed a lot.) Mary was born Oct. 16.

1921 - We left Wm Jewell and wife to look after the ranch and went to Salt Lake City to continue Med. course. 1917 to 1923 were very poor years. We couldn't even have a sale. In 23 Carl Kester our banker had the sale for us - and kept all - all but the lands - that is, all not plundered by J. E. M.

1921 - 22 Had to leave school and teach for we were broke. Taught at Cleveland, Utah. We were the only gentile family there. Got better job (1922) at mid year and taught second half of year at Lincoln School Park City, Utah. Richie was born July 27, at Salt Lake Cy. We lived at 63 Q St. Determined not to teach again although I had accepted a contract to return to Park Cy. I started selling Building & Loan shares for the Intermountain Co. at S.L.Cy. Made more during the summer than I could earn in a year teaching so stayed with it. Changed to the Columbia Savg's & Loan to get larger commissions.

1922 - Esla came in July and we took him to Southern Utah, then to Durango, Colo. and sent him by train to Albuquerque. He lived there for six years, - Till Aug 6, '28. We took a general agency job for the National Cash Register Co and moved to Seattle. We were late getting there and the regional man whom I hadn't seen put another man, M B Crane, over me. Neither of us made good and both quit on the same day. I then tried selling real estate but didn't make many sales. Enough, though, so that we had 1/2 A. in University district on which to build a cottage. 

Winter of '22-'23 - started a sales agency in Seattle. Com. Club closed up all such.^[Added between the lines.]

1923 - Then I sold groceries for Parks Wholesale Co. working the islands and going to    Alaska. Seemed to sell a lot of groceries but couldn't get ahead any. So, from Oct.    1923 till Oct '25 I sold life insurance in Olympia Wn. Everett, Seattle, Bellingham    and Kelso. Then, thinking, on better days I got transferred to S.L.Cy. Soon after     arriving there I was back with the Columbia Savgs & Loan Co and their 2nd Co -   The N.BN.B. Corp. For them I worked in Utah, Nevada, Calif, Arizona, New Mex,   Texas, Kansas, Colo, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wyoming & Idaho. Some of this was     bootleg, no license nor Co. permit.

1926 - Along with Sen. Girard, Atty. Cummings, C W Danson and others we organized the First Natl. Bond & Mort. Co. at Denver. For good reasons we all deserted Girard and I returned to the old job with the S.L. boys. They sent me to Montana in 1927 with $22,000.00 to invest immediately in mtgs. The money was not advanced and I thought best to try it alone anyway. But I failed to get started at Great Falls. Went to Billings and with G E Minty, J. S. Tannehill, & R. C. Dillavons, I started the N.B.C. By the summer  of 1928 the Co was going well and we moved to Billings selling our home at S.L.Cy.

1928 - In Aug. (6th) Esla dies. The same month I hurt my knee again and had to wear a cast for about 2 yrs. Dillivon & Minty had full swing at the office and when we audited in '29 Dill was $29,000.00 in the red and had misappropriated $10,500.00. Soon we were rid of him and before long Minty, too, was out, leaving a debt of over $10,000.00. I was called upon to cover $29,000.00 in order to satisfy state house officials. This I boldly did with my personal note and they let it ride. In 1929 I organized the N.B.I. and sold its stock at twice par, converted all stock to common and all bonds to new 5% long time securities. In 1934 we had $200.00 for every $100.00 bond liability and owned a $60,000.00 53 room bldg. all paid but $12,000.00. Our stock showed a deficit of $7,000.00.

1930 - We bought the home at 115 Av. B. We then had our offices in the Electric Bldg - 202-204-206-208. Our board consisted then of J. Ping, G.E. Harris, L.W. Allard, B.F. Tanner, Judge Pierson was counsel and W. W. Lindsey Auditor. Later we took on CW Dawson in place of Tanner. Our office force at the Bdw. Bldg.:

At one time we had 58 full time salesmen and their sub-agents. Five offices, 3 paid attorneys.

Geo. Porter, for twelve years State Auditor, worked for years to put over the new Blue Sky Laws and that radical champion of the Anaconda Octopus, Montana Life, and others, blocked all competition inside and outside the state. This was accomplished by long 'hold ups' and delay of permits (18 mo. at one time. We were held up until our sales force had dwindled to nine men). Even the large surety companies got into it.

We thought our troubles were over when Porter was defeated by Holmes but Eugene Kelley who took over fully for Holmes was worse than Porter. Everything was done to hold us down. There was no further chance to expand. We were advised again and again to turn our attentions to small loans, etc. Chas. P. Cotter, badger pre-eminent, came into the picture even more at this point than when he served in Porter's office, after the death of Charley Albright.

I put him on the pay roll but his promises brought nothing. He, too, advised giving up all thought of building a large company. He and Rockwood Brown, well known for this and that, took us for large fees and a good double cross. It was plain to see I needed something more promising than NBI so I took up the Chromium promotion which I had been holding off for two years. This appeared to my friends as a fatal mistake and proved so to be, but they didn't know I couldn't run just a bucket shop. I wanted to go on and hoped the Chrome Inc. would take us through.

Three years I fought for Montana Chrome Inc. and three more for the life of NBI putting all I could get hold of into them.

NBI was hurt by Porter and by Kelley. Now Kelley was after me personally and putting on the heat. I held on and called for a show down. He sent his auditors and then broadcast his decision that the Chrome Co. permit would be held up until I was entirely out of both companies. I sold out my control of NBI and resigned from Mont Ch. Inc. It is strange how good men are with you when you are up and against you when you can't win. It seems incredible that the twelve men I had with me on the Chrome board would keep even the money I had advanced to the company. For a few years I thought they would surely share with me but they never have. The company, launched by the war's need of chromium, is doing well. The few grand I put in would help now but I'll make out without it. My wife loves work.

NBI has become the bucket shop it was expected to become. Swaggering, drooling Harry Miller can sit there and draw his 200 or 300 a month for life. That is as far as any efforts of his could ever take him. He is content.

Geo Porter, we heard, was hanged one dark night in his own woodshed. Or was it suicide as the papers said?

This report untrue.^[Written in margin.]

Kelly, - well, the hell with him. Some of the boys are dead, others are drawing dividends on stock I gave them outright. What a world?

I've got to buy, build, sell and trade as never before if I ever get anywhere. It is now Dec. 23, 1942, eight years, or near it, since I counted for anything but the sick husband of an unusual woman and the father of 3 rare and extraordinary girls and a boy destined to far greater achievements than his slower paced father.

What are my excuses for all this? None. Perhaps a better man would have won through. Some things I did I wouldn't do and some things I did not do I would if I had it to do over again. Anyway I kept out of jail and kept my conscience in good order, too.

There is, of course, a satisfaction in creating and carrying on a substantial business, in handling sizable sums of money, in employing a force of office people, salesmen, builders, repairmen, adjusters, etc., & in meeting and knowing well other business heads, and above all in fighting hard for your company. I got a kick out of the many new deals and promotions that came to any man who is known and over rated as a fast promoter and money getter, but I never threw in with any of them - but one, and he cut the corners till we had only an unfriendly circle left from which I withdrew. Of course, there was Mont. Chrome, too. I would never be a Rotarian again, (little chance) even if I had the only business of its kind in America. None owe me more than do some Rotarian brothers whom I trusted, staked, and made well to do. They are the top takers the world over. That's how they got to be Rotarians. When Rich gets back, we'll make it. In our small way we'll get started and we won't need any lodges or clubs to get along. In the meantime I have only to watch my waistline, keep the bats out of my belfry and wait - unless this Reynold's Clinic can qualify me for some sort of work at Vega, which now seems likely.

Disappointments, losses, pain, which uncurbed might bring despair. As I get older I think I really see in them the makers of courage. Anyway, the more I have failed and the greater my failure the greater becomes my desire to get up and go again. Like the insects, I guess. All they know is - "excelsior".

# For Richard

Deplorable that a dad can't always be at hand to do his stuff. That is, he thinks so. He's that way.

A good father is one reasonably assured and satisfied that his kids are the huckleberries and equal to whatever comes, and yet he is not so _narrow-minded_ as ever to deny them his further counsel and admonitory blessings, sundry.

It's something like your mother's brushing off my dandruff and straightening my tie as she would let me out of the car at the office where, barehanded I was to meet our belligerent stockholders and their attorneys and, for the sake of a by-gone hope, search yet some more for a semblance of loyalty among those too much and unwisely trusted directors. Mom was trying her best to help. At worst I looked my best for the occasion. I was never so sure of myself as not to be interested in mom's opinions and ideas. For just a mere woman she knows a lot. She helped me discover the almighty truth and sense of some of these things I'm setting down here before I drive on. It does seem, though, a little like just brushing off the dandruff or telling you to wear your overcoat when you need it:

1. Remembering your solemn pledge to your father never to do so, do not under any circumstances sign another man's note  
#. Avoid any company or partnership not incorporated  
#. Never employ an attorney of mediocre abilities  
#. Beware the competitor's attorney  
#. Do not expect to find honest and intelligent lawyers on every street. There are many, of course, to be found, but you should live so long  
#. Trust very few men 100%  
#. Except in extreme cases never go into a partnership without control  
#. If it is you they want rather than your money say "no"  
#. Do not over insure your life, $10,000 is enough except for business purposes  
#. Analyze critically but do not be afraid to take chances  
#. Listen attentively to your hunches  
#. Quickly forget your losses and unpleasantness of the past that is not useful to you  
#. Avoid all debt, except on real estate, until you have $10,000  
#. After that do not go into debt in excess of 1/4 of your worth  
#. Do not take money from one project to bolster another. Make each do its stuff or get rid of it  
#. Never fleece a man because he is stupid. Natural shifting values and demands will make you rich if men trust you and you know your way around  
#. You make your profit on the buying price, seldom on the selling  
#. It is sometimes OK to be pretty stubborn, provided it doesn't cost anything  
#. If your neighbors seem always to be good you are a right guy yourself  
#. Be generous, never tight. Sane spending and giving comes back like hairy vetch, it also helps you to stay young  
#. According to your position, income and circumstances spend all it takes to live well and to enjoy living to the fullest. Dress well. Keep a good home, set a good table and see that many friends come. You will need them  
#. A man is dead, half dead, or alive according to the number and quality of his friends. Yet only a few in a life time are to be fully trusted. They make mistakes too, you know  
#. You've got to like folks to make them like you. Set about it honestly, naturally. Make it an art. It will make and keep you rich in your heart and you will die happy  
#. Remember, you can never live down a failure in friendship  
#. Tell the truth  
#. Never misrepresent to sell  
#. Never let a friend or anyone else deceive himself. To do so is thoroughly dishonest. Set him right at once  
#. Do not gamble, certainly not for recreation. It becomes a disease  
#. Take no alcoholic drinks with or for man or woman  
#. You more than anyone else I know, should continue to abstain from the use of tobacco in any form  
#. Now is tomorrow. Make every man respect you for what you are at the moment  
#. Avoid the very appearance of suspicion where honor or honestly are concerned. If you are headed wrong take your loss quickly and get straight with the world and yourself. Never mind what it costs to do so  
#. Do not cut corners, but live fully up to the rules  
#. Never leave a friend in doubt of your sincerity. Meet him more than half way and bounce the suspicion out of him. Make him ashamed and do it quickly. Don't let his suspicions grow  
#. Never be advised in matters of conscience. It's a no good advice  
#. Consider well the profound physical effects of any suppressed emotion or frustration. I have found out that you can't live sanely apart from others. You've got to talk things out with others of your own choosing and kind. It's an axiom of living  
#. Marry a girl you can talk with, work with, fish with, think with. Marry a girl you can respect fully as you do your mother and your sisters. None other will do. Mind you, any other will wreck you with her selfishness, or her stupidity, or her coarseness, or her aversion to soap and water  
#. Don't overwork in any way. Create diverse interests for yourself. Never do any hard physical labor you can hire done. You haven't found it out yet, but you are not constituted for continued hard labor. Gotta learn to manage  
#. Don't work always individually for others for wages. You can't get anywhere that way. Save your energy to use in other ways  
#. Never miss a ball game if you can help it  
#. Relax and relax and relax. Study Chinese psychology till you love it second only to your wife and the sprouts. The Chinese are the wisest people in the world. If you can make a close friend of one do so  
#. Do not fear God or fret about who, what, where or how he is. but never get the idea you are smart and don't need Him. No one can half live without him. It's a personal matter. He's here all right. You don't have to be smart to figure that out  
#. While you are still young get wise to the magic of interest. Most people pay interest all their lives and few have anything to show for it. At 6% a single $1000.00 becomes $30,000.00 during a man's active business life if he risks it only on good security. It is easier and more interesting to collect interest than to pay it. Remember this and do not play with other peoples' money. Let them use yours. A good mortgage is better than the security itself. But never take exorbitant interest from folks in distress  
#. Don't ever hope to soften an enemy by saying kind things about him. You've got to say 'em to him  
#. Wanted friendships must be re-newed. They must be kept in constant repair. Also they must be constantly increased, else you will run out of friends. Be sociable always  
#. Hope isn't worth much of itself alone; but without it you are 99% short  
#. When after deliberation you have decided get a move on and do it  
#. Paint will sell it, - to you if you don't watch out  
#. Before you are thirty you should be established and successful, or you would have earnestly tried many things; you can't or won't venture much in your later years. The wise ones never do. Get your "trial experiences" early. Every time you go broke you become a better man if you are still a man

The mockingbird does not look back to see the effect of his wonderful song. A lesson here. We small souls try to make everything circulate inward towards us not toward the circumference of the orbit we could fill if we would. And we are disturbed when we fail to create impressions. Each speaking his own message in his own way and for his own purpose.

# She was dishonest to the end... \
  but we liked her

Mrs. Fred Moyer, our friend was going to die. She knew it and told us. So did her sister and she, too, told us what the doctors had said. I remember, what old Fred had said several times of having to get up with her so many times of nights. It was getting worse. He couldn't stand it much longer. He knew we had little notion of what he was going through.

I met her last in the restaurant. Fred and her sister had helped her to come in. She was eating with gusto, almost excitedly. Most kinds of food had been kept from her for so long. Now like "Old English" she was doing justice to a wonderful dinner. Her eyes shone and she was jolly. I went over and shook hands with her, then left her at once to her turkey and dressing.

That night she was taken to a hospital in Glendale where she died before morning.

Mrs. Moyer had more sense than most. I would remember her always for other things, but I think I remember her most for that last day.

# Perhaps No Kindness Is Ever Lost

>| Certainly the greatest thing in life is Kindness.  
>| They called him Jesus of Nazareth  

This so uncommon one, who long and long ago lived among and as one of the commonest folks; history has never recorded a greater authority on common every day living; no wiser teacher, or more successful doctor of minds and bodies; nor a better neighbor; nor a finer gentleman; nor one whose living has been more respected, or more misrepresented. He did liberate folks from themselves; taught them common sense by simple story, folk take, parable, advice. Ever since then folks have attributed to him much good, some evil, weird and stupid claims. Each worshiping faction strives to tear down the other, believing truly their concepts and interpretations the best (or the only) just and proper views and teachings. Yet all agree he was the best man who ever lived. Who can be as good? or nearly so good?

Well, since you've never done a better thing, write some verses about him. You can't do worse than millions have already done.- nor better.

>| So like a halcyon dream that comes to end  
>| Love that was ours has disappeared but fast;  
>| What good that I accuse? Or you defend?  
>| We should have known it was too good to last.  
 
>| I drew you, deeply breathing, to my breast;  
>| Without a word but more than words could say,  
>| You loved me sweetly sighing as you pressed  
>| Your face to mine and gave yourself to me.  
>| You loved me sweetly sighing, held me close,  
>| And gave your lovely self to me to love.  
 
>| Then suddenly from out the shining blue,  
>| Without much words, there wasn't much to say,  
>| Your soul obsessed, you joined a Vega Crew;  
>| You gave yourself to Vega, - and for pay;  
>| To Vega then you gave yourself away; -  
 
>| You wanted slack, and lunches in a box,  
>| And rides at night with folks I didn't know; -  
>| You think I'm dumb? I'm dumb as any fox, -  
>| When you're from home where do you think I go?!  

# The Valley of the Sioux

>| Now dusk creeps on the hills,  
>| These hills my childhood knew,  
>| And teeming silence fills  
>| The Valley of the Sioux.  
 
>| The cottonwoods dream on  
>| Down where the river still  
>| Flows dark trembling pond pg 147  
>| To foaming flume and mill.  
 
>| From Magic pool and hall  
>| Beneath the river's trees.  
>| Now beckoning spirits call,  
>| Rich - voiced in mysteries.  
 
>| Now from the village tower  
>| Stern warming, but not stern,  
>| The cerfew sounds the hour  
>| And long lost years return.  
 
>| Oh, Peaceful Valley Sioux,  
>| We parted caring much;  
>| The world I little knew,  
>| But gauged your lightest touch.  
 
>| Then I the gladdest one  
>| Climbed these green hills of mine,  
>| To stay the setting sun,  
>| And read tomorrow's sign.  
>| No speech can ever tell  
>| No words can set it down  
>| Of how a boy can feel  
>| Who's been away too long.

# Remembering

>| The morning summer breeze  
>| Blew through my shirt and jeans,  
>| As rising on my toes,  
>| I pumped the heavy pump  
>| To fill the wooden tank, -  
>| And knew my strength, -and felt  
>| A joy within my breast;  
>| For it was good to live, -  
>| And would be better still,  
>| If that could ever be.  
>| You don't forget such things  
>| You live them countless times  
>| And feel as you felt then.  
>| That perky meadowlark.  
>| The same one every spring,  
>| He saw you to the gate,  
>| And swang from post to post  
>| To take you to your work.-  
>| For your return he'd wait.  

# Late Conversation

>| Little Mikie Nelson  
>| He's afraid of the dark;  
>| Trembles! Sits up in his bed!  
>| "What's that racket? Hark!"  
 
>|      BUTCH  
 
>| "Just the wind a sighin'  
>| In the trees, I said;  
>| That's what I been trying'  
>| T'get into your head."  
 
>|      MIKIE  
>|   
>|  "All the same there's something  
>| Standin' there by you!"  
 
>|      BUTCH  
 
>| "You bin' waitin' all this time  
>| T'see what it turns to?"  
 
>| White as chalk is Mikie,  
>| And he's getting cold,  
>| Holds his breath and listens  
>| Long as he can hold.  
 
>|      MIKIE  
 
>| "Funny noise I'm hearin'!  
>| Comin' through the door!"    
 
>|      BUTCH  
 
>| "That's a screech owl, Fraidy-Cat;  
>| You've heard that before."  
 
>|      MIKIE  
 
>| "Noise I'm hearin' ain't no owl,  
>| Maybe it's a bear!"  
 
>|      BUTCH  
 
>| "Wind blows in the key hole;  
>| There's no bear out there."  
 
>|      MIKIE  
 
>| "Someone's lookin' in here!  
>| What's that light, you spose?"  
 
>|      BUTCH  
 
>| "Moon's come up; It's been here  
>| Long time, - while you snoze.  
 
>| Nothin's doin' nothin', -  
>| No bears miles around;  
>| You do too much fussin'  
>| Hearin' every sound.  
 
>| Wind 'l stop a' blowin';  
>| It's just passin' by;  
>| There's no eyes a' showin',  
>| You ate too much pie."  

# Unwanted Interest?

I called frequently on sickly, old Mr. Parker, played Flinch with him. He and Mrs. P., too, truly thought I called because of Mabel who was away at school. The games meant nothing to me but bad breath, coughing and wasted time. I only wanted to do a kindness and kept at it. They did not know what an effort it required to call upon the sick, unhappy, old man. I remember how he would cheat, even at Flinch, and how I disliked the 1% Parkers. Mabel tried but failed to be different. The old man was very happy when playing Flinch and was ready and waiting for the game, reproachful when I stayed away too long. I liked Mabel, just, she was not my kind.
