*Most of Ransom's timeline was taken directly from his writings.*

**Introduction**: Ransom Tone aspired to be someone great. He first set his goal to finish school, then to continue learning through mail order. He began with law and then the medical field. These dreams did not work out but he did have a talent for writing and part of the legacy he left behind is a wealth of information about his ancestors, his family, and his own personal daily life. He begins his own life history by writing, "To my daughter’s Peg, Mary and Phyl and my son Rich the following memory account of unimportant happenings of the very early days of their dad may or may not prove interesting some evening when it’s too cold or too wet or too something else for more important things."

**1884** His memoir states he was born south of Canton on May 26th at 8:00 a.m.  The house is no longer standing.  He was the second child to Myron and Anna Marie.

**1903** Friend, Harry Ericson, future brother-in-law, died. (19)

**1904** Graduated from Elk Point High School.  Sold Chantaugua Industrial Art desks through Nebr. to Beatrice.  Then went to store work in Lincoln and Havelock.  Came back to RR steady winter's job.  Resubscribed for correspondence course in law and worked hard at it. (20)

**1905-06** Entered Dakota Wesleyan University two months late in fall term.  Represented the college at the International Student Volunteer Convention at Nashville, Tenn. in following March. (21)

**1906** Summer at Henkins store.  In fall filed on homestead in Stanley Co. 18 mile north west of Philip on Deadman Creek.  There was no Philip then not even a RR through. (Rapid City was a small cow farm.) (22)

**1907** In October I proved up on the land.  Was offered $2400.00 for my 1/4 sec.  Kept it 14 years and after paying taxes on it sold it for $1950.00.  Worked at Ringsrud Merc. Co. Elk Point in clothing department until summer '08. (23)

**1908** Held rural school house meetings for the National Prohibition Party.  Had my speeches and songs learned verbatim and the office advance-agented for me.  I like this kind of work but was pretty timid at first. (24)

**1908-09** Taught school Vivian, South Dakota.  Lived at Minty's

**1909** Summer school at Dakota Wesleyan University. (25)

**1909-10** Attended Dakota Wesleyan University again.  Summer night school at Philip.  Fisler Inst. Business training, Bookkeeping.  Dr. Ince's office.  Had decided on Med. Course.  Dakota Wesleyan School.

**1917** Married at Great Fall.  Partnership with E. Mattke and Jno. Pierce.  Farmed their land, also mine and Deyo place. (Dried out) (33)

**1919** Had knee operated. (35)

**1920** Moved to Frances heights Ranch.  480 acre wheat that year and 810 acre flax. (Very poor crops hailed a lot.)  Mary was born October 16th. (36)

**1921** We left Wm Jewell and wife to look after the ranch and went to Salt Lake City, Utah to continue Med. course.  1917-1923 were very poor years.  We couldn't even have a sale.  In 1923 Carl Kester our banker had the sale for us - and kept all - all but the lands - that is, all not plundered by J. E. M. (37)

**1921-22** Had to leave school and teach for we were broke.  Taught a Cleveland, Utah.  We were the only gentile family there.  Got better job (1922) at mid year and taught second half of year at Lincoln School Park City, Utah.  Richie was born July 27th at Salt Lake City.  We lived at 63 Q St.  Determined not to teach again although I had accepted a contract to return to Park City.  I started selling Building & Loan shares for the Intermountain Co. at Salt Lake City.  Made more during the summer than I could earn in a year teaching so stayed with it.  Changed to the Columbia Savg's & Loan to get larger commissions.

**1922** Esla came in July and we took him to Southern Utah, then to Durango, Colorado and sent him by train to Albuquerque.  He lived there for six years, - till Aug 6, 1928.  We took a general agency job for the National Cash Register Co. and moved to Seattle.  We were late getting there and the regional man whom I hadn't seen put another man, M B Crane, over me.  Neither of us made good and both quit on the same day.  I then tried selling real estate but didn't make many sales.  Enough, though, so that we had 1/2 acre in University district on which to build a cottage. (38)

**1922-23** Winter started a sales agency in Seattle.  Com. Club closed up all such.

**1923** Then I sold groceries for Parks Wholesale Co. working the islands and going to Alaska.  Seemed to sell a lot of groceries but couldn't get ahead any.  So, from October 1923 till October 1925 I sold life insurance in Olympia Wn. Everett, Seattle, Bellingham and Kelso.  Then, thinking, on better days I got transferred to Salt Lake City.  Soon after arriving there I was back with the Columbia Savings & Loan Co. and their 2nd Co., the N.B.N.B. Corp.  For them I worked in Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona, New Mex, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wyoming & Idaho.  Some of this was bootleg, no license nor Co. permit. (39)

**1925** Fourth child, Phyllis born June 29th. (41)

**1926** Along with Sen. Girard, Atty. Cummings, C. W. Danson and others we organized the First National Bond & Mortgage Co. at Denver. For good reasons we all deserted Girard and I returned to the old job with the Salt Lake boys.  They sent me to Montana in 1927 with $22,000.00 to invest immediately in mtgs.  The money was not advanced and I thought best to try it alone anyway.  But I failed to get started at Great Falls.  Went to Billings and with G. E. Minty, J. S. Tannehill, & R. C. Dillavons, I started the N.B.C.  By the summer of 1928 the Co. was going well and we moved to Billings selling our home at Salt Lake City. (42)

**1928** August 6th Esla died.  The same month I hurt my knee again and had to wear a cast for about two years.  Dillavon & Minty had full swing at the office and when we audited in 1929 Dill was $29,000.00 in the red and had misappropriated $10,500.00.  Soon we were rid of him and before long Minty, too, was out, leaving a debt of over $10,000.00.  I was called upon to cover $29,000.00 in order to satisfy state house officials.  This I boldly did with my personal note and they let it ride.  In 1929 I organized the N.B.I. and sold its stock at twice par, converted all stock to common and all bonds to new 5% long time securities.  In 1934 we had $200.00 for every $100.00 bond liability and owned a $60,000.00 53 room building all paid but $12,000.00.  Our stock showed a deficit of $7,000.00. (44)

**1930** We bought the home at 115 Ave B.  We then had our offices in the Electric Bldg. - 202-204-206-208.  We had over 300 men but not more than 65 full time at any one time.  We had more than 3000 stockholders and bondholders.  At one time we had 58 full time salesmen and their sub-agents.  Five offices, three paid attorneys. (46)
Geo. Porter, for twelve years State Auditor, worked for years to put over the new Blue Sky Laws and that radical champion of the Anaconda Octopus, Montana Life, and others, blocked all competition inside and outside the state.  This was accomplished by long 'hold ups' and delay of permits (18 months at one time.  We were held up until our sales force had dwindled to nine men). Even the large surety companies got into it.

We thought our troubles were over when Holmes defeated Porter but Eugene Kelley who took over fully for Holmes was worse than Porter.  Everything was done to hold us down.  There was no further chance to expand.  We were advised again and again to turn our attentions to small loans, etc.  Char. P. Cotter, badger pre-eminent, came into the picture even more at this point than when he served in Porter's office, after the death of Charley Albright.

I put him on the pay roll but his promises brought nothing.  He, too, advised giving up all thought of building a large company.  He and Rockwood Brown, well known for this and that, took us for large fees and a good double cross.  It was plain to see I needed something more promising than NBI so I took up the Chromium promotion, which I had been holding off for two years.  This appeared to my friends as a fatal mistake and proved so to be, but they didn't know I couldn't run just a bucket shop.   I wanted to go on and hoped the Chrome Inc. would take us through.

Three years I fought for Montana Chrome Inc. and three more for the life of NBI putting all I could get hold of into them.

NBI was hurt by Porter and by Kelley.  Now Kelley was after me personally and putting on the heat.  I held on and called for a show down.  He sent His auditors and then broadcast his decision that the Chrome Co. permit would be held up until I was entirely out of both companies.  I sold out my control of NBI and resigned from Montana Chrome Inc.  It is strange how good men are with you when you are up and against you when you can't win.  It seems incredible that the twelve men I had with me on the Chrome board would keep even the money I had advanced to the company.  For a few years I thought they would surely share with me but they never have.  The company, launched by the war's need of chromium, is doing well.  The few grand I put in would help now but I'll make out without it.  My wife loves work.

NBI has become the bucket shop it was expected to become.  Swaggering, drooling Harry Miller can sit there and draw his 200 or 300 a month for life.  That is a far as any efforts of his could ever take him.  He is content.

Geo Porter, we heard, was hanged one dark night in his own woodshed.  Or was it suicide as the papers said? (This report untrue.)

Kelly, -well, the hell with him.  Some of the boys are dead, others are drawing dividends on stock I gave them outright.  What a world?

I've got to buy, build, sell and trade as never before if I ever get anywhere.  It is now December 23, 1942, eight years, or near it, since I counted for anything but the sick husband of an unusual woman and the father of three rare and extraordinary girls and a boy destined to far greater achievements than his slower paced father.

What are the excuses for all this?  None.  Perhaps a better man would have won through.  Some things I did I wouldn't do and some things I did not do I would if I had it to do over again.  Anyway I kept out of jail and kept my conscience in good order, too.

Disappointments, losses, pain, which uncurbed might bring despair.  As I get older I think I really see in them the makers of courage.  Anyway, the more I have failed and the greater my failure the greater becomes my desire to get up and go again.  Like the insects, I guess.  All they know is - "excelsior".

**1934** Moved to Junction City, Oregon. (50)

**1942?** Moved to California. (58)

**1960** Died February 22nd from coronary thrombosis.  Last address was Thermal Trailer Park Hwy 111.  He was cremated and his ashes remained in the possession of his wife until she moved into a nursing home in 1995.  At that point they came into the possession of Gini Tone Norgard until his wife dies at which time their ashes will be mixed and scattered off Mingus Mt., Arizona. (75)
