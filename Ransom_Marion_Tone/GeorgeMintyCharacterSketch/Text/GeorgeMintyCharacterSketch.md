(Use this to begin "The Strange Friendship". Old George)

On the dilapidated porch of a small sunbrowned house at the edge of town a bent, grizzled, old man his hands clasped behind him walked slowly up and down.

I made out at once that it was he. I stepped over the slackened barbed wire and crossed the unkept yard. So like him the meaningless surprise he feigned. Now, after all the years our eyes met again. Some sort of smile fought for the heavy lips, then was lost at the down drawn corners of a hate-hardened mouth. He limped lamely and let his ponderous weight down into one of the faded upholstered chairs. I stood while his tired rheumy eyes burned brazenly up and down and over me then dismissed me utterly and finally. He got to his feet with effort. The dark countenance glowered as he turned away and entered the ramshackled house. He closed the door behind him. I stood staring at the closed door. Then with a mighty blow I kicked the door open and entered.

(Stick to facts this one-sided friendship will be strange, unusual, interesting, provoking.)

He had the wrong idea of living even early in life.

He was new in town, 18, and a big fellow, tall and straight and broad shouldered. Describe him and his indulgent hardheaded, scheming mother.

Every girl our age in town--

Being our new minister's son--

Grownups didn't like him - except when he sang and the boys soon shunned him, for he was too arrogant, show off, selfish, so much "it". But I was different, I guess, and perhaps needing such a one - Our vastly different backgrounds, experience, he halting at nothing I diffident, a little timid, lacking decision and confidence. The worst sort of friendship - for me. He was far from stupid, had nerve and a thick skin. Pretty likely to succeed when settled down and straightened out. Men thought so. He wasn't handsome yet he was, and he possessed a big, booming, base voice. His and our college days.

He and Nell and the other girls, and her anxieties she had fallen for him from the first, she knew, he knew, and so did everybody else.

On the side and out of town he tried other girls of wealth and talent and looks, failing with them. How it went with Nell till her father's death. The Christmas. I  helped her.

Then adjustment, and they married, and he took over. The wedding, the doctor, others and their remarks.

Then the idle playing around, Sioux City, the races, fairs, ball games, theaters.

Then the ranch, his indolence, their company car, company land, machines, credit, borrowing, notes, failure of the big, lazy farmer. Nothing ever paid.

Her trust and his wayward unfairness. Going to leave her.

His sales ability. *How* he sold.

Black listed and black balled.

The mistake and what he did to the company and to me and us.

How he could organize propaganda and use men against each other.

His gold Co. trickery. His use of her friends and their money. His utter lack of principle and conscience. Unwelcome he made himself right at home among those who disliked him most.

His theft had to be covered at the office. Still not satisfied he went out for revenge and got it.

His face, his greying hair, smoldering dark eyes.

His grief real enough, but it won't last. He may even yet marry his 250 grand, who knows?

Such a character should be written up, perhaps to show what a mother can do to ruin her son. And how a weaker friend can fail to help.

The Little Town That Wasn't There

My big criticism would be lack of dialog and incidents put in here and there rather than joined in a chain and elaborated into completed chapters each with a little climax.

You wouldn't begin a novel with this chapter would you?

It was in the early fall when we were on our way to the Exposition at Chicago that we drove across the new Sioux River steel bridge that has replaced the old one at Canton. I wanted to show the family where I attended school for a quarter day and what a grand little place Beloit probably still was.

But I was disappointed, for no town was there for us to see. I couldn't show them any of the old places. They were gone. Not a house nor building was in sight at first except the mill. The old Zippy House and trees were gone and only a field was there beside the unshaded river bank. Only a low plowed hill marked the place where Kittybelle burned her fingers in the taffy and Nell, her Mamma, chopped the wood after Frank, her Poppa, had gone to his work.

Polluted with sewage, the murky water of the river was disappointing. The mill was there to the south and running too, with the swallows swarming as before at its high eaves. And would you believe it, Bumbie's little cottage in which our old pal used to mend our shoes and talk to us in his strange language. Our old house with its steep pitched roof had burned down and the grove was shabby and thin over the weedy grass and ugly blackened foundation. They told us that all of the good houses and store buildings had many years before been moved to Canton, two miles up the river.

Back in the trees near the river was an old, run-down and empty house, windowless and with only half a chimney still standing. I took it to be the old Starr house where lived that quaint and kindly couple so interested in and good to all the kids of my day. They had been gone to their heaven for a quarter of a century and more. It was just beyond this house in the pasture in the dark woods behind the gate bars that the old witch had waited evenings to catch me, but had been foiled time and again by my thoughtful precaution to take my mother along with me when she went to fetch the cow.

## II

On the Dakota side of the Sioux River some two miles below the town of Canton and close up to the river's muddy clay bank, there stood many years ago, a low, unpainted, weatherbeaten cottage. It stood quite alone, its shed roof well hidden from the river. To the exact southwest, its opposite and shorter roof faced the afternoon sun which did its best to reach and brighten more than just the front door stoop. But I believe even the generous and faithful sun must have felt the hopelessness of the dark, as this lonely little recluse of a house drew back into its dark, leafy shawl and its too well shaded backyard. Through small, close set, somber eyes it looked out hopelessly, morosely from its shadows, apparently uncheered by the gradual rise of green pasture which lay before it to the west beyond the border of the river's trees.

In this lowly and lonely cottage, askew with the world, I was born one Sunday morning at eight o'clock. The renowned midwife, Gehan, brought and left me on our front door step. We always liked Mrs. Gehan. She brought two of my brothers also. Before I was old enough to remember we moved to the village of Beloit just across the river in Iowa.

The interstate road coming from out the bridge's high span cut the village in twain and disappeared over a low hill to the east where the grey stone orphanage glistened and shone in the late afternoon sun. At its widest space the unkept road was our main street with its Post Office and two stores just a stone's throw off the bridge.

The Zippy house across the river was haunted. Everyone in town knew that. Often after crossing the bridge, careful not to get slivers in our feet, we would stand in the road's warm dust, our hands shading our eyes, intent upon discovering some moving object over there. Our failure to do something authentic to the facts already accepted did not make the hauntings any less real.

Unfortunately, too, and to my great anxiety our new home was directly across from this dangerous place and not far from the river and the woods, -- the dark woods in the pasture which furnished an appropriate and concealing habitation for an old witch who, though seen by very few, was well known to quite a number of the parents of small children whose homes were hear the river.

Of evenings I would go with Mother to let down the bars and follow the cow home, but even that was done at great risk. The pleasure of these trips waned as I learned more about the old witch with the sharp eyes and the big nose, who wore a dark shawl over her head and carried a long knife. She did not like trespassers on her land which extended to the gate and all along the river. She was especially prejudiced against small boys.

Father, al tall sandy-bearded individual, became one of us all of a sudden. He seemed stern and very quiet; but he liked my Mother immensely and all of us some. His eyes were kind and his voice low and soft, to a child a likeable thing in a man. I would sit near him and touch him if I could, and liked to hear him talk though I have no memory of what he said. Father could beat even me running. We often raced down the clay path at the front of the house. There was no sidewalk nor any gate to stop us.

Father caught the measles. So did we all except Mother. We kids were pretty sick and Father was blind for awhile; neither could he speak, so could not scold nor fret anymore. But with a heavy stick kept at the head of his bed he would stamp on the floor and mother would hurry to his room after ordering us all to be very quiet. It took Father a long time to get over the measles so we could play again.

Mrs. Pedelty, a tall and well proportioned, aristocratic English lady with high color in her handsome face and a strangely soft, melodious voice what lent no end of charm to her English accent, kept the Post Office and ran a delicatessen and candy shop in connection with it.
