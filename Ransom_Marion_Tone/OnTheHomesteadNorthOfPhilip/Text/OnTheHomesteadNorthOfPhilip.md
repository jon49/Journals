May 1907

Sunday – Went over to J's to do the chores. Cold and storming – an inch or more of snow and more coming. Mr. Culp and Mrs. Randall went to the P.O. so I gave my mail to them. I stayed at J's for dinner and Cy. W. and I cut wood for Mrs. J. She had to have wood, tho it was Sun. A letter came from father; came home – read the "inter Ocean" and "Herald," played went to bed at 10:30.

Monday – Sun is bright and snow is melting fast – meadowlarks are singing as tho there had been no storm. P.M. This morning I cleaned house tho not very thoroughly. D. Randal came and talked with me for a few minutes while I was diging[sic] on my well; Went up to do the chores; went on over to father's place – back to F.J.'s – over to Culp's – Randall's – W. Reynick and home – couldn't get bread in the whole neighborhood but I had a little on hand anyway, raked my front yard a little, laid some more stones for walk. Went to creek for water. I think I must have walked six or seven miles to day. Cris came but did not stay long – said he had been sick for a day or two. 

Tuesday – Got up early – went to G.M.J.'s to do chores – to Culps for milk, to Randall's for bread, to Reynick's for eggs – but got no eggs. Cris went to Grindsone – but did not bring my wire. I met Joe Reynick at Culps. He said he had killed the first "rattler" of the season.

Wednesday 1. Went to Johnson's and left my mail with Mrs. J. & Tena. Mrs. Culp and Tena went to Smith. Gust came on that day. A letter came from father, mother & Sadie.

Thursday 2. Went to Ladgen's to get box father sent out from Pierre. Joe seemed well pleased with his chairs. Joe R. came and we went up to Cris' and went with Cris to look at land west & north of him. To Culp's, and Randalls.

Friday 3. Got up at 5:30 o'clock. Helped Mr. Culp with his well diging. Caught a fierce cold and have been feeling pretty dumpy ever since.

Saturday 4. Cris & Dudley R. were here nearly all day.

Sunday 5. Went to Johnson's, father's, Teeter's, Norman Bryan's, Culps and back home. Dudley was here for two hors. Or so. Went back to Johnson's to get my mail. Cris had gone to Culps and had taken my mail with him so I went there and we came across to my house. He had gone on home. No letters came today. 

Monday 6. Dug in my well. Went to Culp's, to Tena's and from there with Mr. To get the stove at father's. I was "strictly all in" when I got home.

Tuesday 7. Snowed a little in the night. I was up all ight last night. I have done nothing to day except to chop a little wood. I read nearly all day. Wrote a letter to Esla. 

Wednesday 8. I certainly got up early on Wed. morning. Have been trying to fast as much as possible on acct. of a sore stomach. I went to Cris' at daylight. When I got there it was Hi [sun itme] Cris wasn't up but I soon woke him. From there I went to Elieson's and from there home. Went to Culp's – got two qts of buttermilk. Went to Randall's for bread; came home had dinner. While I was having dinner the folks bound for E.P. [Eleeson's, Cris, O. Munson & Whittecar] drove past and I didn't get to say farewell to any of them. Now the only persons left, whom I knew before I came up here are Oli Clemenson & G.M.J. He, Oli, lives nearly two miles north from here. Went to G.M.J.'s for mail. Read the Co. papers, the "E. Herald," "Farm" paper. Played the violin. [All along here for the past week, I ought to have spoken often of playing the V. It's my chief occupation.] 

Thursday 9. Worked hard nearly all day in my garden. I planted nearly all the seeds I had left from first planting that can be planted now. Now I have nearly ½ A. of garden. It was broke last fall and disked this spring so beats the sod for garden. Yesterday I commenced the sod banking which I am going to put around my house. It will make the house cooler. Went to Eleeson's for water.

Thursday 9. Planted nearly all of the garden seeds I had left. _Very_ tired.

Friday 10. Gust Johnson came and stayed for an hour or so, then Norman Bryant came and we went up the creek to get some trees. We had only started away from my house when we met a rattle snake. I went back to the house and got my "snake stick" and we put him to death – for trespassing. His rattles were small so we did not take them. While we were gone we saw five snakes, three of which were rattlers. We killed them all but one, a water snake that fell into the creek and got away. One was a very large one being as large around, I think, as the bottom of a [no2.] lamp chimney. It was less then 3 ft. long. It's rattles were broken and partly gone. It was the largest rattler either of us had ever seen. We came home with all the small threes and cuttings we could carry. I was very tired for we went up the creek as far as Peterson's sheep ranch. After we had dinner, or supper [it was both], Norm went home and I went to the creek and set out my trees.

Saturday 11. The hottest day S.D. ever had, I think. Cloudy & sultry. But no rain. I made my screen door. I had already put screen on the windows but it was so warm I had to have the door open. Thot I would roast while I was washing my dishes – which had been left for two days – more or less. Went to G.M.J.'s to leave my letters. Gust was writing his letter for "Courier". To Culps for milk.

Sunday 12. Walked to Smith to see Mr. Elliot. Went with Mr. Kana to buy some cows. Bot some seed potatoes. It was dark when I got home. Went to Johnson's after mail. It is snowing.

Monday 13. Still snowing. Cold and dark. The screens on the windows are drifted full of snow. I just carried some small logs up near the door, so in case the storm lasts for 6 or 8 months I won't perish. Not for lack of fuel, anyway. A little after noon Mr. Kane came and said his horses were gone. He thot[sic] they were stolen for they were valued at $400.00. He was going to Smith & then to Midland. I went South to look behind the hills. We met east of Culps, each seeing the horses at the same time. Kane went home feeling pretty good. I went on over to Culps and Randalls. Mr. R. was at home.

Tuesday 14. Bright and warm. The snow is going fast. I have spent the whole day writing and reading.

Wednesday 15. Mr. Culp broke an acre for me to-day[sic] and I planted the whole of it beans, alfalfa, and onions.

Thursday 16. Dug post holes for fence around garden. I rained late in the evening and to-day[sic].

Friday 17. Has been very warm. Nearly everything in the garden is sprouted. I worked on fence to-day[sic]—dug 43 holes.

Saturday 18. It has rained nearly all day but is clear now and cold. Mr. Randall took upper with me- doing most of the cooking himself. We had potatoe[sic] chips, baked beans, sweet biscuits—donated by Mrs. Culp--, buttermilk, raisin sauce, dark cake, current jelly, and _strong_ tea. Mr. R. stayed until about 10:o'clock. Then I wrote a letter to mother and read a little.

Sunday 19. Clear but cool. I am not so clear myself for I worked in the rain yesterday and have a fierce cold today. Stayed at home.

Monday 20. Very warm and sultry. Heavy rain in evening and nearly all night. I "laid off" and rested all day.

Tuesday 21. I rested on Tues. also.

Wednesday 22. Went with Gust to skin a rattle snake he had killed over at Tena's. Tena wasnn't up yet. Later we went to father's, then to M.M.J.'s, then I went home and to Ladgens, then back to Johnson's for the mail, then to Culp's and Randall's and home. 

Thursday 23. To Ladgen's and with his team I hauled the posts and wire "_49 posts_" from his place to my garden. Then I took some of my posts over to father's and brot[sic] back some of his along with some other things. Then I went to the creek and put the posts in their places, then worked on fence around my house. _Very_ tired. I am now in bed writing this. It is not yet 8:o'clock.

June 1. Saturday. Went with Tena to call on Lola Sharp. She left on Sunday for Sioux City. I stopped in to talk a while with Mrs. [Grandma] Randall. We killed a small R. snake at father's place, skinned it and I have the skin ready to put on a belt.

Sunday 2. Monday. Tuesday. Nothing doing. Just living--absolutely nothing else.

Wednesday 5. Killed another R. snake, skinned him and put the skin on a belt without tanning it. It stays fine.

Thursday 6. Gust and I drove to Peterson's ranch to get small trees. Got about 100 each and set them all out the same day. I worked until 8:o'clock.

Friday 7. Rain & lots of it.

Saturday 8. Just lived.

Sunday 9. Went over to Tena's & from there we went to father's, killed a R. snake with 7 rattles, skinned it and put it on Tena's belt, leaving the rattles on it. It certainly is a peach of a belt. In my mail to-day[sic] a letter came from Madison asking me to come to take charge of the boy's club at the Assembly in July.

Monday 10. Cleaned house.

Tuesday 11. Raked my yard.

Wednesday 12. Scrubbed the floor and cleaned everything up slick for I expected father & mother to come. They haven't come yet. I ought to have waited another day before scrubbing.

Thursday 13. Father came, but mother, being sick could not come.

Friday 14. Went to father's place, then to Ladgens and down to my garden.

Saturday 15. Father went someplace and was gone all day, but I stayed home.

Sunday 16. He walked to Smith but I stayed home again. Mr. & Mrs. Johnson & Tena took supper with us. 

Monday 17. Father & Gustav left for Phillips at 5:o'clock in the morning. It seemed very lonesome after father was gone. I had to "_Lock up_".

Tuesday 18. Dudley R. came early in the morning & later Gust came bringing some things father sent from Phillips. Among the things was some _beef stake_. It was the _first_ fresh meat I had seen since February. Gust stayed to dinner. School election today at Moleynox's but I didn't go. Same board was elected.

Wednesday 19. Thursday 20. Friday 21. Saturday 22. Went to father's place to fix fence, found that Joe's cattle had been there and killed many of the small trees.

Sunday 23. Killed my 9th rattler today. Only one letter came--that from Percy. 

Monday 24. Went to Ladgen's. After I got home Mrs. Randall came to get a book "Coneston" which I loaned to her. 

Tuesday 25. I had to "lock up" and go for a tramp – got pretty lonesome. Gust stopped in the evening as he returned from GrindStone. 

Wednesday 26. Thursday 27. Friday 28. Saturday 29. Went up to Chris' place, Gust going with me. Hotest[sic] day [118].

Sunday 30. Went to Smith P.O. with Gust. It was the first time I had been there since some time in May when I went to get seed potatoes. A storm blew up that time and I nearly froze. There was quite a little crowd there. Sunday school services were held on the creek, east from the store and the phonograph inside entertained, with comic songs & band music, those who were not interested in the S.S. service. The mailman [another new one] drove in on time, his horses, on the jump, and was greeted with a feeble cheer by the men, who all dislike waiting all day for their mail. Everybody at Smith is everybody'' friend and introductions are mere "put-on's" and are not needed. Not all are "Rhubens', by a long ways, though some of the bachelors could easily "clean up" a little better perhaps. I got a small armful of mail, so did Gustav and after making a few light purchases we started for home arguing about the amt. Of mail each had received[sic] – he claiming that I had the most & I that he got more than I did. I stayed at Johnson's for dinner & then Gust came over here to get some veg. From my garden. Norm, Bryant & his cousin came and we spent the afternoon resting in the shade and listening to Norm.

Monday July 1. Went over to help Bryant move his house. Got back home at about 5, o,clock. Mr. & Mrs. Teeters & Lillian came and spent the evening with me during which time I rendered, to the very best of my musical ability, several tunes on my violin.

Friday. Allan R. came early to tell me that Mrs. J's pony was sick. We doctored him up the best we could according to a small book Mrs. J. had; then I went to culp's for milk; to Randall's, borrowed a little soda came home by way of G.M.J's, ponly was allright[sic]; there I found the old cat, which followed me home; Randall boys came and offered to show me how to make pancakes. Dudley does know how, I guess, but I haven't yet got over the effects of the three he made for me. The boys went home as soon as I started to dig on my well. Perhaps it was all right, tho, for it was very hard diging[sic]. Chris came in eve. We talked Debs, and Roosevelt, and Harriman, and finally began to talk German. Chris reading some poems by Schiller. I learned several idiems[sic] and new phrases, one – "Ich nehme an"^[I suppose]. It was after 12: o,clock when Chris went home, but I was not tired and did not sleep for some time after.

Saturday. cold and snowing, much snow on ground, snowed nearly all day, I studied the cookbook for a long time in the a.m. Now I think I can make pancakes, rice pudding with raisins, and tomatoe[sic] soup. Mr. Culp came to buy the stove which I traded to him for 1 acre of breaking. He tuned up the violin and played several tunes before going. I washed up every dish that was dirty; fixed up my stove pipe; blackened the stove so it shines now; cleaned the floor a little. Sawed, and split some wood. Tryed[sic] to play the V. Read a little. Have been sitting here by the stove, writing ever since. It is still cold with high wind. I am kept pretty busy putting wood in the stove. It is just about the time of night the folks left, one week ago – seems longer. No, there is one more day yet for they went on Sun. night.

April 20th. The folks left for Midland at 11: o,clock P.M. Mr. Culp taking them. I stayed at their house. Didn't sleep much. Got up at just daylight. Cooked a big breakfast – couldn't eat to save my life. Went over to J.M. Johnsons, hitched up the pony for Tena and then came on to my house. Played? On my violin - , mouth organ, - tryed[sic] to hum a tune, couldn't do it; tryed[sic] to read; tried[sic] to sleep - , couldn't do anything, not even dig post holes for I was too tired; Chris came but left soon because he had bread to bake. I wasn't hungry so didn't get dinner. At 6: o,clock P.M. I "broke fast". In the evening I cleaned up my house a little and read some from "Black Rock". 

Tuesday. morning I let the alarm ring and stayed in bad until 8:o,clock. After breakfast I went up to J.M.J.'' and got the pony -–went over to Father's place and brot[sic] home some things they left for me. In P.M. I took Chris' windless home and helped him to finish diging[sic] his well; brot[sic] windless back and took pony home. It was very dark when I got home; read Inter Ocean Courier, and leader; clipped some poetry for my scrap book. 

Wednesday. Snow storm last night; still snows; read cook book; after B. I fixed up my cellar and moved things around pretty much; Went to J.M.J.'s to care for pony; to Culp's for milk. Tena was there and this time she was _not_ crying; came home and worked on my well; made a handle for my spade; had dinner and supper to-gether[sic]; played the violin; read "E. Herald"; wrote letters.

Thursday. Went to Smith P.O. by way of Tena's, taking Mrs. J.J. and children to stay with Tena. Si W. was there; Returned from S. by way of Tena's and left pony there. Walking home I stopped at father's place as I went and got some dishes; took Elieson's mail to them then dug on my well. While I was gone some one piled some things in front of my door; played on V.
